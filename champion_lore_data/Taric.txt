The Shield of Valoran

Taric
was born and raised in
Demacia
to continue with his family's long tradition of military service. Taric showed martial prowess during his arduous training to become a warrior and yet he would always serve his homeland through other ways during the little free time he had; if not lending a hand volunteering to the
Illuminators
then he would be tending the sick or helping to rebuild Demacian homes damaged by flooding. Taric would also lend his artistic perspective and creative talents to stonemasons and craftsmen who raised monuments of
The Winged Protector
and the ideals it represented. To Taric, art and life alike would make what Demacia is worth fighting for, even though he wouldn't exactly define nor limit what or whom he was protecting.

Military Life

Taric
had a steady climb through the ranks of the Demacian military. Even though he did find criticism from fellow soldiers and commanders, Taric would dismiss their reproaches and continue to live by his ideals of appreciation for life's beauty either by roaming the forests looking for rare animals to gaze upon, skipping his combat drills in a tavern while listening to a bard’s ballad, or being absent during line inspections to ride out and watch the night sky across the hinterlands.
Eventually, Taric was promoted to a position inside the
Dauntless Vanguard
where he was expected to follow a much higher conduct standard. Despite his actual position, Taric would continue to follow his ways and start to feel at odds with himself, a behaviour which soon would be percieved as insubordination by his peers. Upon noticing this,
Garen Crownguard
(who Taric had previously fought alongside before in his younger days) advised him to take shape on his duty since he saw in Taric the potential for him to become one of Valoran's greatest heroes and so, Taric was assigned to service the Sword-Captain of the Vanguard as a way to keep him from demotion. Both Taric and the Sword-Captain not being particularly fond of this decision. Sometime after, an unnamed battle waged where Taric had abandoned his post to wander a ruined temple nearby, and without knowledge of this battle, the Sword-Captain and dozens of soldiers of his retinue were slain during the time he was absent. When Demacians found out of this tragedy, Taric faced an death sentence for the dishonor of breaking his oath with the Vanguard. Even though Taric knew that neglecting his duties was the reason of his execution, the weight of guilt for those who he had failed and died because of it was greater than the punishment itself.

Garen then intervened as much as possible, for Taric's affront couldn't be overlooked. Seeking mercy for an old friend and using his position as next Sword-Captain in line he sentenced Taric to the "
Crown of Stone
", a most ancient Demacian tradition consisting in sending a dishonored soldier to ascend
Mount Targon
in search for redemption. Although because of the nature of the punishment it was certainly a death sentence. Traditionally, the Crown of Stone would allow the exiled to start anew far away from their homeland— yet Taric refused, taking sworn on the challenge to atone for what he had done.

The Ascent

Taric
took the first ship south and climbed
Mount Targon
, a journey who would test both his physical body and soul. During the ascent, Taric was haunted by those who he had abandoned in battle, trying to bring his will down. At some point he met the ghost of a Noxian soldier who belittled his Demacian origin, telling him about how the Mountain held nothing but death with no honor involved and how he should give up on his quest. Taric mantained as ever persistent and gave the soldier his own cloak, continuing his ascension to the peak. As Taric pressed on, he was soon plagued by visions of disasters such as the
Alabaster Library
setting aflame only for him to dive right into the flames and retrieve the poetry
Tung
once had written, or the last of the dreamstag being thrown by the
Frostguard
into the
Howling Abyss
so Taric could leap down in a desesperate attempt to save it; or his worse one yet, the mangled corpse of
Garen
swinging from a gibbet over the
Inmortal Bastion
's gates, then Taric would rise his shield and charge into the endless hordes of Noxian soldiers before him. The beauty he much cherised in art and life would die before him in this visions over and over again. These would eventually fade upon the arrival at the top of the Mountain, where a
10
man-shaped being
with an entire crystalline appearance would loom over him like the stars themselves, speaking truths of the world in a thousand whispers who cut through Taric like a blade, and which Taric somehow had always known. His every decision led him to Targon, where he was meant to bestowed the Aspect of the Protector.
Now he is to fulfill his newfound oath as the Aspect of the Protector, where he would stand as the steadfast Shield of Valoran in great wars yet to come.
