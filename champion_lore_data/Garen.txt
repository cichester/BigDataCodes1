Garen is
Lux's
older brother and their family name is Crownguard. He deeply respects and loves his sister, but he fears what may happen to her if her magical abilities were to be revealed.  He and their aunt,
Tianna Crownguard
, planned on arranging Lux to marry prince
Jarvan IV
in order to protect her from persecution. After the events of the
Lux comic
, Lux got Garen to verbally acknowledge that she was a mage. The two parted ways on good terms. In the end, Garen ended up accepting his magician sister and that not all magicians are bad people. Garen then found and reunited with Lux in Terbisia. However, the two have a fall out due to the events of the Great Mage Rebellion. Garen was then able to reconcile with his sister, vowing to never abandon her again as they stand together against the Mageseekers. As their family name implies, they serve and protect the crown.

It is hinted that Garen and
Katarina
have feelings for each other. Then there are those who imply it to the point of confirmation:

"
Kat
and
Garen
sitting in a tree~ And you better just be holding hands or I'm telling!"
"
You
live by a code that'll never let you get what you want. Let me take you to
her
."
"Don't starve your heart,
child
! Let me deliver you to
him
."
"Honor? Duty? Ha! What
your
heart demands is all that matters."
"No love is impossible, my god demands you follow
your
desires."
"The always-enchanting tale of
star
-
crossed
lovers."
"
Your
finale will be a
duet
."
"Stop carving words into my bark! Everyone knows
G
<3
K
!"

Their special interactions with each other and various others in
Legends of Runeterra
suggests that at some point the two are in a romantic relationship, which they try to keep secret.
