Nunu is a kind, excitable child, eager for adventures and travelling. Having listened to the stories of his mother since he was born, Nunu dreams of being a mighty hero, fighting against terrible foes and exploring the world.
After the loss of his tribe, Nunu felt great sorrow, but nevertheless remained hopeful. Desiring to help his new caretaker Lissandra, and wishing to fullfill his dreams of being a hero, Nunu went to face a terrible beast and prove himself a hero for his peopleâ€”only to meet Willump and befriend the yeti, the two forming an intense and loving bond.
Having been protected by Willump for a long time, Nunu is somewhat sheltered from the more complicated and darker aspects of life. He tends to see the best of people, for better or worse, and tries to fit them into his very naive beliefs about the world. Nunu also has a hyperactive imagination, often coming up with fantastic ideas to entertain himself and Willump.

Mystical Empowerment:
Nunu was blessed by Willump with the powers of a gem of dreams, granting him the power to make his imagination come true. Due to his inexperience, Nunu's powers have yet to reach their peak.
Ice Magic:
Nunu can create and summon ice to his aid, and to help his allies. He can create icy constructs like bridges and walls, or summon near infinite snowballs to throw at his foes. He freezes his foes with ice, slowing them down to hamper their abilities.
True Ice:
Nunu is capable of summoning True Ice, magical, unmeltable ice.
