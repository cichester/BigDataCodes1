Karthus was born in a poor area just outside the capital of
Noxus
, living in an almshouse with other families. Fascinated with death, Karthus would sneak into the rooms of those about to die and wait beside them to watch them, intent on seeing the moment of their death. He would not see this moment until his sisters came down with the plague. He looked after them, and as they died, Karthus realized that he wanted to experience whatever was beyond death.

After the tally-men of
Kindred
collected his sisters' bodies, as was custom in the parts of Noxus where they lived, Karthus followed them, asking them questions along the way. The tally-men soon accepted Karthus into their ranks, first as a grave digger, then pyre builder, then a corpse collector. Eventually, Karthus worked in the temple of the tally-men, tending to the sick in their final moments. As they died, he asked them what they saw and what layed beyond death.
After watching many more die in front of him and getting unsatisfying answers from those that he questioned, Karthus decided that he couldn't learn any more from the living. so he would instead try to learn from the dead. After learning of the
Shadow Isles
from the dying people that he questioned, he decided to leave the order of tally-men and journey to the Isles himself.
After a long journey, Karthus finally arrived at the shores of the Shadow Isles. As the Black Mist entered Karthus and ravaged his body and soul, his desire to transcend mortality stopped him from dying. Instead, his body was transformed, and he was put into the threshold between life and death. Karthus decided to preach death to the rest of the world, and as he killed the fisherman that brought him to the Isles, he vowed to bring death to all.

Karthus is a thin man wraith with unnaturally colored skin, pale white in some areas and pure black in others. There is blue light eminating from the crevices where his eyes and mouth would be. He wears the traditional clothes of a member of the tally-men of
Kindred
, dark red and grey robes with armored cuffs and shoulderblades. He carries the staff of a tally-man of Kindred, with a grey handle and a spike at its tip. He also carries a book with him, with it likely containing either prepared laments for the dead or spells and enchantments, possibly both.

Wraith:
Karthus is one of the Shadow Isles's wraiths, created when the Ruination came to be. The Black Mist consumes one original personality, leaving only a specter consumed by negative emotions and obsessions. In Karthus case, he became an spirit that sings for the dead.
Immortality:
Being already dead, Karthus can't die again. He can only be banished and lose his material form for a while.
Spiritual Construction:
Wraiths can create solid constructs from spectral energy, such as bodies and physical objects. These constructs mainly base themselves around how they looked in life.
Transitory State:
Being ethereal beings, Wraiths can shift from the physical world and spiritual one at will. This means they can become intangible and invisible, and disappear from one place to another.
