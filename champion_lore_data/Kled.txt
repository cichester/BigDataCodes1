Kled is a slender, pale-furred yordle with short white pointy teeth and violent eyes. His robes are composed of a red ribbon holding his hair, a (sometimes invisible) piercing on his left ear, a hat with a steel spike pointing upwards on the front and two arrows pointing forward on the top of the hat, steel shoulder pads, leather sleeves, steel bracelets, a red belt, leather boots with steel plates, and other garments with a distinct palette of red, teal, brown and grey. The most distinctive ornaments of his attire are an axe, a gun, and a hat.

Personality
[

edit source
]

Kled is a stereotypical hillbilly, with a distaste for "city folk" and a fierce sense of independence from society. Paranoid and territorial, Kled views all of
Noxus
as his property, and will gladly kill anyone he views as a trespasser. Though Kled doesn't answer to the
Trifarix
, he has fought alongside and inspired Noxian forces with his fearless and violent attitude for many centuries, and has been decorated with many honors. Because of his military titles (which may or may not be made up), Kled takes pride in his accomplishments and uses them as a means to prove his superiority over others.
Kled is very unfriendly, cursing often and is prone to violent outbursts and shouting. Kled shows a greedy side with his insistence on claiming land, and often places signs marking "Property of Kled" whenever he thinks something is his. Because of his short temper, he constantly berates his
Drakalops
steed,
Skaarl
, for her cowardly and unreliable nature. However, Kled does have a soft spot for his untrusty steed, and is overjoyed whenever she returns to help him in battle. Though his chaotic nature makes others wonder if Kled is mentally unstable, Kled considers himself to be a genius.

Though they are cute, Kled considers yordles to be unwanted guests, and does not feel remorse for killing them, nor for feeding them to
Skaarl
.
