Early Life
[

Ivern the Cruel was a renowned warlord of ancient
Vorrijaard
who followed the war principles of
old gods
like
Volibear
. When the
Three Sisters
rose to power and their armies enhanced by
dark magic
, the regional factions were conflicted on whether to destroy them or leave them to their own devices. Ivern and his clan decided to plot for the
Iceborn's
defeat. However, after sometime, Ivern instead led an expedition to the land all magic flows from, in hopes that he could harvest its power for himself.
Ivern and his clan sailed east. Upon reaching
Ionia
, they quickly paved their way through the region by conquering a dozen coastal settlements. They were met with great resistance by local
Vastayans
, who attempted to drive back this existential threat to their homeland with force. Ivern cut down any who stood in his way. He led his group to the sacred grove
Omikayalan
, also known as "the Heart of the World", and later discovered the legendary
God-Willow
. The God-Willow was a colossal tree with gossamer leaves that shimmered gold. He realized the Vastayans - who were so desperate to protect this tree - would also die for it. Wishing to break their resolve, Ivern hacked at the God-Willow with his war axe, again and again, until the tree was felled, and with it, Ivern the Cruel was taken with it.

Reborn as the The Green Father

As the God-Willow faded from existence, Ivern fell into deep contemplation, where he found strange beauty in the bursts of life that emerged from the death and destruction he caused. While ruminating on this, he noticed that he grew in height and that his limbs lengthened. His body, once made of flesh, was now coarse with bark and leaves. He began to hear the very land around him weep. Realizing what he had done, Ivern was suddenly wracked with deep remorse and melancholy for the suffering he inflicted. As Ivern cried for forgiveness, time marched on, until what felt like unfathomable eons elapsed and the sadness and violence he once felt faded from existence, replaced with the new world he now lived in. From then on, Ivern took to his new form as Ivern the Green Father. He enjoyed communicating with flora and fauna, rivers and dirt, and developing close friendships with forest critters. He understood that he now bore the God-Willow's legacy, which meant he was entrusted to cultivate and help humanity grow in its beauty. This was a responsibility he would take with great earnest.

Appearance

Ivern's entire body is made of living wood. He is thin and as tall as a grown tree, with legs that narrow into roots. His head is pale wood that sprouts  moss and mushrooms, which spirals outwards into two large protrusions. This gives the appearance of two great horns resembling an old Freljordian helmet, a remnant from his former life. From his head, leaves grow in places where hair would normally be, giving him a lush beard, pair of eyebrows and a mane of hair behind his horns. On his right arm is a woven gauntlet with various moss and mushrooms growing from it. In his horns, across his roots and in his left arm, rings of gold still remain.

Personality

Ivern the Cruel was a fierce and ruthless warrior who abided to warlike traditions of old Freljordian gods. After cutting the God-Willow and becoming Ivern the Green Father, his demeanor completely changed into one that was cheerful and whimsical. Deeply attuned to nature, humans may find him strange and eccentric. He is curious and benevolent, often nurturing the growth of the natural world wherever he can find it. Those who seek to harm the denizens of the forest, however, will find that Ivern's magic can harm as well as help.
