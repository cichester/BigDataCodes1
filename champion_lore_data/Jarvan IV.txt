Jarvan IV was saved by
Shyvana
after escaping and later helped her in slaying her mother and, out of gratitude, she earned a spot in the Demacian Elite Guard. Jarvan mentioned he loved someone that wasn't so different from the mages. It was later revealed to be Shyvana.

Luxanna Crownguard

Jarvan IV was arranged to marry
Lux
by her family to protect her from being persecuted for being a mage: as queen, she would have been too powerful to accuse. After she didn't show up for the betrothal ceremony, the matter was apparently dropped.

Tianna Crownguard

After his father's death, Jarvan is counsel of many prominent nobles—including Garen’s aunt, High Marshal
Tianna Crownguard
to prepare him for the days ahead before he can be crowned king.
