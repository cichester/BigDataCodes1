Early life

As a child, Braum was larger than other Freljordian youths. His mother taught him not to use his size to intimidate or bully and taught him that true courage was not about dominating, but helping those in need. One day, an enemy tribe was attacked by ice giants and Braum's mother did not hesitate to help them. Braum was confused why she would help their enemies, but thanks to her kindness, said tribe became allies. Braum then understood his mother's philosophy that all of the Freljord was a family, and he pledged to bring that family together. Braum helped people in his home town by saving them from danger and bringing hope wherever he goes.
Eventually, he realized that he was needed in more places than his home, so he bid his mother a tearful farewell as he went off on his quest. His heroism and good deeds inspired people all over the Freljord to tell stories about his feats, but some were unrealistic and exaggerated. One myth told that Braum's signature shield was an indestructible vault door made by the demigod Ornn, which he broke from its hinges by punching the rocks surrounding it in order to save a troll boy trapped within. Braum laughed heartily at the stories he'd heard about himself, but rather than refuting them, he embraces them, as he won't let the truth get in the way of inspiring others.

Contemporary history

Braum later travelled to
Rakelstake
to hear the words of Ashe, a leader of the
Avarosan
, a tribe who followed the teachings Avarosa of the
Three Sisters
, whom Ashe is said to be the reincarnation of. There he also met Tryndamere, a barbarian who was determined to prove his worth by dominating every opponent he could face. In one duel, Tryndamere became increasingly lost in his fury and was actually about to kill his opponent, but Braum intervened by holding up his shield, and Tryndamere kept attacking the impenetrable shield until his rage subsided. After that, they became good friends, and it is even said that Braum was the one who introduced Tryndamere to Ashe, his now wife.
Braum has no specific allegiance, as he believes that all within the Freljord are brothers and sisters. He is reliant on Ashe as they both share a goal to unite the region, and the Avarosans have adopted him as their own. He often tells adoring children that he wishes for the Frejlord to settle their differences and then retire to become a poro herder.
Braum sees no-one as an enemy of his. However, the Frostguard, led by Lissandra, are hunting for him and he does not understand what they want from him. Still, he has fought against the Frostguard's forces numerous times in order to defend innocents threatened by them.
