Sivir was born in Shurima, her childhood was very hard as her parents were killed by looters and she alone had to grow up on the streets along with other orphans stealing food from local markets and delving into ancient ruins in search of trinkets that she could sell.
Sivir sometimes had to fight with the other children to keep some of the loot they found, but she rarely kept anything, after her so-called friend Mira tricked her and stole it, Sivir swore to herself that no one would ever come back to betray.
When she reached adolescence she became the guide and lackey of a group of mercenaries led by the well-known daughter Siharo, although her skill with weapons led her to become Siharo's sergeant, Sivir realized that she was left with most of the treasures even if they were obtained thanks to Sivir. Sivir gathered her fellow mercenaries and rebelled against Siharo, the two duelled and Sivir emerged victorious, but was unable to kill her mentor and abandoned her in the desert wishing her luck to rebuild her life.

Sivir and her mercenaries earned a great reputation which was known throughout the desert, they accepted any task offered to them if the pay was very good, one day she and her companions were given the task of recovering an ancient relic known as the Chalikar .Accompanied by the buyer's personal guards, Sivir searched for the relic for several months and finally found it, the weapon left Sivir amazed as it was quite magnificent, the captain of the guard told Sivir to give it to her but she refused and with just one movement of the weapon decapitated him and all his followers and Sivir fled with the weapon in hand. Sivir's reputation grew further and she became known beyond the desert, when the Noxian expeditions heard about her, it was
Cassiopeia
Du Coteau who was most interested in her exploits and proceeded to hire Sivir to sack the ancient city of Shurima.
Little by little they entered the ruins of the city, several of Sivir's companions died due to the constant traps they found, but Cassiopeia refused to back down, when they reached the great door of a tomb surrounded by ancient statues of guardians and reliefs of the warriors of the past ,Sivir was quite captivated by those beast-headed beings and their great fights against monsters of the underworld, taking advantage of Sivir's distraction. Cassiopeia stabbed Sivir with a dagger in the back causing her to scream in pain and collapse soaking the sand her blood, Cassiopeia took the Chalikar from her dying body to open the door to the tomb, unaware that it unleashed a powerful curse. Near death, Sivir watched as the statue of a giant serpent came to life and proceeded to spray Cassiopeia with his poison.
Sivir took her Chalikar and tried to flee from the tomb, but near the exit life began to leave her body and she fell to the ground, the last thing she heard before she fainted was the roars of maddened Gods being released from the tomb .But surprisingly that was not the end because she opened her eyes and realized that her wounds had healed and in front of her was her savior.
Azir
the last emperor of Shurima, he explained to her that Sivir is his descendant and that through his veins runs royal blood. He explained to her that the blood he had spilled had awakened her spirit and he took her to the pool of life where he healed her wounds. Azir later began to complete his ascension and Sivir watched in amazement as he became an Ascended and the ancient Shurima began to rise from the sands. Sivir quickly ran out of the pool and saw how the ancient Shurima returned from the grave. Now Sivir, along with
Nasus
and
Taliyah
, is preparing to decide whether to embrace the fate they gave her or forge her own on the sands of Shurima.

Personality
[

Sivir is possessed of a mercenaries' code of values and isn't motivated by anything as much as material wealth. Causes, nobility and matter of honor pale in her eyes when compared to the alluring clinking of coin. Shaped by a harsh childhood spent trying to surviving and make a living in the Shuriman Sai while always on the lookout for betrayal, Sivir is inherently a distrustful person. This is evidenced by her being slow to let down her guard around Taliyah even though the Stoneweaver had been the one to rescue Sivir and stitch her wounds after finding her bleeding outside Vekaura. Sivir's pragmatic self-interest plays a large part in why she doesn't embrace her role as Azir's heir, preferring her modest life as a mercenary/fortune hunter while avoiding the destiny seemingly placed before her.

Sivir wants nothing to do with
Azir
, for even though he saved her life she doesn't want to owe him anything, let alone assume the responsibility of uniting Shurima which, in her eyes, will always be a lawless, ruthless land. Sivir seems to have descended from
Azir's
illegitimate child whom he was never aware of.
Xerath
will hunt her down no matter what, for in her he sees the shackles that still bind him as well as the decadent society that brought him nothing but misery.
