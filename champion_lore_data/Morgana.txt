Early life

Morgana and her twin sister
Kayle
were born on
Mount Targon
during the height of the Rune Wars to
Kilam
and
Mihira
, the current Aspect of Justice. Due to Mihira ascending while pregnant, the sisters were born with a fraction of her celestial power. As the war raged on, Mihira's celestial power began to overshadow her personality and affections as she dedicated more and more of her time to her duties as an aspect. Fearing what Mihira was becoming, as well as the enemies drawn to her light, Kilam resolved to take their daughters to safety. He fled
Targon
with his children and they would sail to the land that would be known as
Demacia
.

Becoming Demacia's Winged Protector

The sisters grew to having distinct and clashing personalities. While Kayle was arguing about the settlement's rules, Morgana would empathize with the newly arrived refugees.
One day, Mihira's sword would fell from the sky and clash into two. From that moment, feathered wings bursted from the sister's backs and remained, confirming the celestial magic would still remain inside them. While Kayle embraced her new power, Morgana resented her gifts. One day, the settlement was attacked, and the sisters flew to aid the people of
Zeffira
. While Kayle was busy dealing with the frontline attack, Morgana learned of a hidden wave of enemies attacking the city and left the frontlines to aid the citizens. After the battle Kayle lost trust in her sister for leaving her on the battlefield. Since that day, they were hailed as the Winged Protectors.

Battle with the Darkin Blade

Morgana and
Kayle
at the gates of ancient Demacia.

Kayle and Morgana put on their armors and helmets, and stood against an army before the city walls. They easily destroyed the first wave. Sensing the danger approaching in the skies, the Winged Protectors took flight without hesitation and engaged in a deadly battle with
Aatrox
, who managed to possess a new host. Aatrox was too powerful to be defeated physically for the sisters. As the last stand, Morgana left her sword behind, and stood against Aatrox, binding him with her chains of dark flame. Taking Morgana's sword, Kayle empowered her wings and sword with celestial flames and burned the mortal body of him, sealing Aatrox within his own blade.

Battle of the Winged Sisters and  Departure

Warriors flocked to Kayle's banner at Silvermere's Peak, where she founded a judicator order to enforce the law, and hunted down rebels and reavers with equal fervor. Kayle allowed Morgana to rehabilitate wrongdoers who appeared humble enough to admit their guilt. However, some people in the Judicator Order and especially Ronas, one of Kayle's ardent disciples, decided to arrest Morgana and her followers when Kayle was bringing justice upon a distant kingdom ruled by a cruel, unrighteous king. In an attempt to protect her followers, Morgana conjured magical chains of fire and bound him until he fell dead. His death led to an outbreak of riot in the settlement.

Kayle

When Kayle found out what happened, she became enraged and with her power she summoned divine fire to punish the sinners and Ronas' killer. Morgana flew up to meet her, the two dueled in the sky, knocking down columns where they passed and killing people without realizing it. It seemed that one of them was eventually going to win but Morgana faltered because she and Kayle heard their father's screams and stopped fighting. Their father was mortally wounded, Morgana hurled her sword at Kayle through tears, and plunged to the surface like a meteorite to cradle her father.
She took her dying father in her arms, and in a sea of tears, cursed her heavenly inheritance for the destruction around her. A moment later, Kayle landed too, and between sobs Morgana asked her if the purification of mortals by smiting included her father. Kayle kept silent, grabbed Morgana's sword and soared into the heavens without looking back, disappearing. Morgana, hurt, tried to tear off her wings because now they were a reminder of her pain, she tried everything to remove them but could not do it, so she decided to tie them with steel chains to walk in the world of mortals. Morgana was known since then as the Veiled Lady.

Life as the Veiled Lady
[

Over time, Morgana's role as one of the Winged Protectors of Demacia would fade into obscurity, with few knowing that there were in fact two protectors. Instead, Morgana would become known as the Veiled Lady or the Veiled One, a deity that Demacian's would pray to in order ensure their loved ones passed safely into the afterlife. Morgana would walk the realm, embracing mortals and enacting justice when needed.
One day, a cleric and his pupil entered the woods to find the Veiled One, for the Pupil had erred. After listening to them, The Veiled One chained the sinful cleric for hitting the pupil in front of her eyes and forced him to endure all the shame, suffering, and loneliness he had inflicted on his pupils. On another day, she saved two girls from the men with swords, asking question about their village, and threatening them.
She currently resides in Sacred Woods outside of Demacia, waiting for the day she is needed again.

Excerpt from Morgana's Journal

For centuries, Morgana has tried to find her sister, and written down her findings on her journal. A
Solari
warrior reported a sighting of a winged creature on the peaks of the mountain, ascending higher. A wind mage said that a bright flame streaked through the air, spinning away faster and faster. A Demacian noble was convinced that the Winged Protector was still alive, so he sent out rider to track her. After decades, the riders found a single white feather beneath Targon. A
Lunari
child, in the middle of the night, said that he saw a winged ghost, flying around the mountain. Yet, his mother did not believe him.
Many centuries passed, and Morgana heard a voice. A lonely, so distant prayer. She had no idea where it came from, but it was unmistakable; it was Kayle praying to her. However, Morgana didn't answer.

came to Morgana, bruised and bleeding after the battle with

. Morgana welcomed Nilah and her crew in her sanctuary, offering them healing for their wounds and much needed breathing place. The crew confided in the Veiled One, and shared their stories and missions. However, their meeting was interrupted all of a sudden.
Outcast and imprisoned mages -who escaped the ship of Mageseekers-, and the followers of the Veiled Lady were under persecution by the Mageseekers. They were trying to reach the sanctuary, yet one of them got caught.

Main article:
The Mageseeker

When the rebellion of the mages of Demacia broke out,
Sylas
, one of the most powerful mages of the
rebellion
, decided to go into Sacred Woods to find the Veiled Lady in search of power and knowledge for his cause. She told him that he should fight with her as a test to have the knowledge. After the fight, Morgana refused to give Sylas the information he was looking for, because she saw that in his heart there was only vengeance and hatred.
As Sylas makes his way to the Veiled Lady's refuge, he reflects on how he failed to save Leilani. When he reaches Morgana, Sylas finally understands why he failed her test, his rage and vengeance alone isn't enough to win them this war. Seeing him humbled by his failures, Morgana, satisfied and ready to give Sylas her blessing, shows him the true origin of Demacia.
Sylas realizes Morgana was one of the Winged Protectors, alongside her sister Kayle. When he asks why she doesn't reveal herself, Morgana replies that if she returned, so would her sister, and Demacia isn't ready for her judgment. She then presents him with one of her sister's feathers and uses it grant him her blessing, the ability to show the vision of Demacia's foundation.
Now, the people of Demacia know that there were two Winged Protectors during the foundation of the nation, since Sylas showed the vision to the common folk.



Appearance
[

edit source
]

Morgana is a  slim and curvy young woman with dull pale skin, dark purple short hair with a bang on the left side, bright violet eyes with makeup runnings, pointy ears, dark purple lipstick and four wings on her waist and two wings on her nape that vary in black and purple colors. She was ascended on her thirties, so her aging has stopped since then.
Her attire consists of a long dress that matches the color of her wings, revealing her arms and neckline, leaving her back uncovered, and with various chain ornaments behind her wings and hips.

Personality
[

edit source
]

Contradicting everything they think of her, Morgana is not the "evil twin"; she is just an incarnation of the other side of justice, while her sister Kayle represents blind justice, Morgana represents compassionate justice that consists of listening to reasons first for the sinners' actions before deciding whether or not to punish them. Indicating that Morgana is fair and compassionate towards people.
At first she rejected her celestial powers and that caused them to become corrupted, but she sees them as a perfect weapon to punish in a fair and compassionate way, so as not to forget her humanity and her emotions. Since she could not cut her wings, she tied them. Having her wings tied together symbolizes that she still has humanity inside her and although Kayle is her rival, deep down she still loves her and wishes that one day they can be together again as sisters and not as enemies.
