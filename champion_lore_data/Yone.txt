Early life
[

edit source
]

Yone was the older half-brother of
Yasuo
. While
Yasuo
was impulsive and arrogant, Yone was disciplined and patient.
As Yone trained in the village's renowned sword school, his skill with the dual blades drew admiration from his peers. When
Yasuo
initially denied the personal tutelage of Elder Souma, Yone gifted him a maple seed as a symbol of humility. Later,
Yasuo
would be taken as Elder Souma's pupil, with Yone's guidance.
One day, when news reached the village that Noxus had invaded, Yone and other members of the village went to help defend the land while Yasuo was held back to defend his master.
When Yone returned,
Yasuo
had disappeared, and Elder Souma was discovered dead.
Whether Yasuo had shirked his duty or betrayed his master, Yone felt he had failed in his duty to show Yasuo the right path.
Yone and Yasuo clashed in a fated duel and Yasuo's legendary wind technique had the upper hand. Yone died before he was able to learn the truth.

Post - Death
[

When Yone died, he woke up in the Spirit Realm, he was then confronted by the azakana that had been hunting him prior to his death. He fought the azakana, coming out victorious before a new darkness took him. Upon waking up in the material realm, he was adorned with a mask in the form of the azakana he defeated with the demon itself locked within. Unable to remove it, but now able to see azakana in the world around him.
Now, Yone hunts azakana, using the blade he took from his own demon as the tool to kill them and take their masks. He uses their names as words of power, turning the weakened azakana he hunts into masks, later to be added to his belt.

Yone in life was a tall young man with white skin, tied dark brown hair, brown eyes and a beard. He wore an Ionian dress with dark aquamarine blue colors with gold trim with a long red belt, seen in his
LoR card artwork
.
When he came back to life, his appearance changed, now adorning a scarlet red mask on his face that cannot be removed. His hair now worn loose and long with two strands at the front, and his eyes shine in a ghostly blue.
His attire consists of torn and bloodstained Ionian clothing, wearing no shirt and instead is covered in primarily bandages that extend up to his shoulders and just below his chest. His robes and belt being decorated with the various
azakana
he has hunted.
When Yone separates his soul from his body, his appearance is the same but semi-transparent and wrapped in a bright scarlet red.

Personality
[

]

Yone is a stoic, loyal and honourable man who always put his responsibilities before his feelings. He had a complicated relationship with his brother
Yasuo
, having to take care of him at a very young age. Yone wished for
Yasuo
to learn responsibility and have a better life, and was elated when
Yasuo
was chosen by master Souma as his disciple.
When he discovered
Yasuo
's "betrayal", Yone was devastated, but continued with his duty which was to, sadly, kill his brother.
When Yone finally found and confronted
Yasuo
, they ended up dueling to the death, with
Yasuo
as the victor.
When he returned from the dead, Yone dedicated himself to understanding what he had become through hunting azakana, as he feels that the conflict he now faces with the mask he wears outweighs the unresolved conflict between him and his brother.
According to rumor, Yone and
Lillia
share a deep friendship, much like the bond between
Yasuo
and
Taliyah
.

Yasuo
[

]

Yone is the older half-brother to
Yasuo
, whom he was very close to. Yone taught Yasuo many important lessons when he was young. When Yasuo was running away when accused of killing Elder Souma,
6
Yone
was heartbroken and filled with negative thoughts and feelings that fed the azakana he would later confront. When Yone finally caught up, Yasuo was forced to kill his own brother whose death would haunt him for a long time.
Later, when Yasuo went to the Spirit Blossom festival in
Weh'le
, he was confronted by a resurrected Yone who was trying to kill an azakana that pretended to be a monk from the
3
Greenglade Elder's
order.

After Yasuo let go of his own past, the brother defeated it and parted way in peace, although Yasuo was expecting Yone wanted vengeance. It isn't clear if Yone has forgiven his brother, or if Yasuo has forgiven himself.

Lillia
[

Yone met
Lillia
at some point (likely when they were both traveling to the Spirit Blossom festival of
Weh'le
) and has vowed to protect her from any azakana and Demon of Nightmare during their travels.
Upon Yone's release, it was heavily hinted that the relationship dynamic between Yone and
Lillia
is meant to mirror the master / student dynamic of
Yasuo
and
Taliyah
. The latter is mentioned in the story 'The Unforgiven' - "In her, Yasuo saw an unlikely student, and in himself, an even more unlikely teacher,"
[

]
and the latter is further supported by Michael Yichao, Yone's writer.

"Fun fact: Yone knows and has met Lillia! He is rather protective of the innocent dream fawn."
