Early life

Tryndamere was part of a nameless barbarian tribe known for their stamina and prowess in combat, which forged blades based on their god's tusks. They fought raiding tribes, the beasts of the mountains and
Noxian
armies trying to claim territory in the Freljord. As he grew up among his tribe, Tryndamere developed into a strong warrior.
One night, the tribe witnessed an unnatural storm from the east, where the
darkin
Aatrox
stood before them. Some of the barbarians bowed to him under the belief that he was their
Boar God
, but he slaughtered them all. Filled with rage, Tryndamere charged at Aatrox, but was swatted away. As he lay on the verge of death, he was revived by a rage he never felt before, his willpower and thirst for vengeance preventing him from dying.
Tryndamere found his tribe's last remaining survivors, knowing they were doomed with enemies surrounding them throughout the Freljord. Hearing rumors of a tribe which worshipped the reincarnation of Avarosa, they set off to the west where they met the
Avarosan
. Eager to gain respect among the tribe, he challenged the Avarosans to duels. However, they began to fear him due to his savage, furious way of fighting and how his wounds regenerated faster the more rage he held. In one duel he was so lost in his fury that he was on the verge of killing his opponent, but
Braum
, an
Iceborn
allied with the Avarosan, stood in the way with his shield. Tryndamere kept attacking Braum's unbreakable shield until his rage subsided, and the two eventually became friends. Afterward, the tribe's survivors were welcomed into the Avarosan and Tryndamere was arranged to form a political marriage with the Avarosan warmother,
Ashe
, but the two slowly grew into a genuine relationship.

Tryndamere wears heavy, dark armor that covers his lower body, forearms, and parts of his chest. The armor has a textured, almost metallic look, with sharp, angular edges and layered plating that resembles dragon scales or ancient, battle-worn gear. The dominant colors are black, silver, and teal, giving the armor an ominous, magical appearance. There are glowing accents in the teal hue. His upper body is mostly bare, showcasing his muscular, well-defined physique. There is a band of leather or metal across his chest, connected to the shoulder armor. His skin tone is pale, contrasting sharply with the dark and heavy armor pieces. Tryndamere wears a helmet with large, curved horns that extend outward and upward. The helmet is designed with sharp lines and patterns. His face is mostly obscured by the helmet, but his eyes are intense, and his facial expression looks serious or stern. He has long, flowing black hair that cascades down his back. He wears a gauntlet on his left arm, which are heavily armored, and his hands are partially covered.

Ashe
and Tryndamere are Bloodsworn, a political marriage, but the two eventually developed genuine affection for one another. Tryndamere originally married Ashe in exchange for the protection of his remaining tribe after
Aatrox's
massacre. All of this is, in turn, an inside reference at Riot. The name of Riot's co-founder
Marc 'Tryndamere' Merrill's
wife is
Ashley
.

He is hostile towards the Winter's Claw, who disdainfully lumped him into the Avarosa's "decadent lifestyle" even though Tryndamere actually originated from another hardy nomadic tribe, much like
Sejuani
.
