Early Life

As a child, Renekton was a fearless fighter, often engaging in street fights out of pride and enjoyment. Although his older brother
Nasus
disapproved of his behavior, Renekton continued to fight and fight, completely ignoring his brother's thoughts.
Later on in life, when Nasus left to join the prestigious Collegium of the Sun, he concerned about his brother getting killed by the fights he constantly getting himself into with them grew bigger as days passed. Eventually, he was able to help him enter into the
Shuriman
army, though he was underage.

In the army, Renekton found a new purpose and fought in numerous battles with the help of his brute strength and
Nasus'
strategic planning, including in the battle of
Zuretta
where he single-handedly fought one to ten and won, successfully held off until Nasus and his reinforcements intervened. He earned the title of "Gatekeeper of Shurima" after the act.
As he served the army for many decades, he earned a reputation for himself, with the aiming to be stronger than any other living entities and even overpower the
God-Warriors
, but inside that battle-scarred body lies a caring heart and a place for his brother Nasus. When he learned of his brother's impending death due to a curse, he immediately rushed to the
Sun Disc
, where Nasus lay barely alive. To save his brother's life, Renekton carried him up the stairs of The Sun Disc, knowing that the process would likely obliterate him. Despite his unworthiness thoughts, Renekton's sacrifice led to the ascension of both brothers, with Renekton becoming a powerful crocodile.
With his new powers, Renekton continued to lead the Shuriman army to victory for centuries, becoming an unstoppable force topping the power of his old-self, following Shurima's footsteps in every victorious battle. Though as the centuries went on, many believe his mortality was lost when he stepped into the light. When
Nashramae
was captured and put under the law of Shurima, the crocodile beast went rampage and destroyed the grand library, completely annihilated it during the siege of the place. Nasus, hearing this, arrived at the scene to confront Renekton, causing his bloodlust dissipated under his brother's stern gaze and he turned away in shame.

During the battle of
Icathia
, Renekton fought alongside
Aatrox
,
Nasus
, and several other Ascended beings. However, things took a turn for the worse when the
Void
was unleashed during the battle , inflicting the dangerous
Voidborn
upon them.
Around the same time,
Azir's
ascension was sabotaged by
Xerath
, who killed him and stole his power. When the brothers learned of this, they hurried back to the capital. However, upon their return a few days later, Xerath had absorbed so much energy that he had become nothing but solid energy himself, making him the most dangerous
Baccai
ever unleashed.
In an effort to contain Xerath's power, the brothers managed to trap him within a sarcophagus but it was not easy since Xerath retaliated. It took a while for the duos to force him down the empire's tomb. Renekton then ordered Nasus to seal the tomb, knowing that he himself would be trapped there with Xerath for eternity. With a heavy heart, Nasus carried out Renekton's order and sealed the tomb, leaving the two trapped in the darkness forever.

Tomb of the Emperors

Trapped within the tomb, Renekton continued to battle Xerath in the darkness. However, as centuries passed, the isolation and the unending battle took a toll on Renekton's mind and willpower, causing him to slowly lose his grip on sanity. Xerath, taking advantage of Renekton's weakened state, began to poison his mind and twist his thoughts.
Renekton soon became convinced that Nasus, his own brother, had been jealous of his power and had taken pleasure in locking him in the tomb with Xerath. This delusion only served to fuel Renekton's anger and despair, leading him to lash out at Nasus whenever he thought of him.

Descent into the Tomb

In the year 989 AN,
Sivir
, a treasure hunter hired by
Cassiopeia
, ventured into the tomb in search of riches. However, Cassiopeia betrayed Sivir and inadvertently released both Renekton and
Xerath
from their imprisonment.
Upon his release, Renekton, driven by the scent of his brother, immediately set out to find
Nasus
. However, he soon discovered that the world he knew eons ago had changed drastically, as he now wandered a desert landscape vastly different from the one he remembered. He surveyed the familiar scorching desert of
Shurima
he once had known and continued his search with a single-minded focus.

The Sandthrashers

Main article:
With Teeth

As Renekton searched the desert for his brother, he stumbled upon a group called the Sandthrashers led by Sai-Surtha. Upon discovering the group's latest victim, Uksem Heartsplitter, Renekton demanded to know the whereabouts of his brother. Instead of answering his question, Sai-Surtha's challenged Renekton to a duel.
Even when being haunted by memories of Xerath's power, Renekton emerged victorious from the battle, though he was sliced into pieces before re-forging himself and throwing the Sandthrasher's body into the jaws of a nearby predator. Turning his attention to the remaining members of the group, Renekton confronted
7
Raz Bloodmane
, who suggested that Nasus might be found near the cliffs of Azuma.
Choosing to spare Raz's life, Renekton left the group behind and continued his search for Nasus.

Note: The following information comes from
Legends of Runeterra
and may or may not be considered canon to the official timeline.

While searching for Nasus, Renekton encountered a sand runner who had been sent by Azir to collect a medallion from the Sandthrasher's cavern. Cornering the runner near a sand spire after escaping the
1
Bloodthirsty Marauder
, Renekton attempted to take the medallion, but the runner managed to escape by dodging Renekton's axe and triggering a cave-in.
Later on, Renekton joined forces with the Sandthrashers and found a tower where Nasus was being held. However, upon seeing his brother, Renekton was consumed by the poisonous thoughts that Xerath had implanted in his mind ages ago. He crashed into the wall and found himself in the
3
Chamber of Renewal
with both Nasus and the sand runner from earlier.
In a fit of rage, Renekton attacked Nasus, allowing the scout to use the portal that Nasus had just gone through to escape. As the battle between the two brothers continued, they both grew to a gigantic size, towering over everyone else. The outcome of the battle and their fates remain unknown.

Appearance

Renekton is a hulking monstrosity, being bipedal like a human but with the head of a crocodile. His body is covered in scales, green in the back and pale tan in the front. His beady, yellow-orange eyes seem to glow with pure rage. Each limb has only four digits, all with sharp, black claws. He has a long, reptilian tail.
Renekton generally wears only a few pieces of armor, silver and intricately crafted, on his head, shoulders, neck, forearms, and shins. Aside from this, he wears a faded greenish-brown loin cloth. His weapon of choice is a massive crescent-shaped axe.

Personality
[

Even when Renekton was still a noble warrior, he has always had a violent side, liking to get into fights as a result of his hotheaded and unpredictable nature. When Renekton became an Ascended, he sometimes embraced his animalistic side while in battle, destroying entire cities in ways that shocked even those who saw him as a hero. While he was renowned for his cruelty and ruthlessness in battle, Renekton was still good at heart and cared deeply for his brother
Nasus
, even willing to sacrifice himself to save him, but these traits left Renekton vulnerable to
Xerath's
influence in the millennia they were locked away, and ultimately became Renekton's defining traits in his insanity.
While Nasus believes his brother is truly gone, some remain hopeful that the old Ascended hero could one day reclaim his old humanity to defeat his new, tyrannical master.

Nasus

Nasus is the older brother of Renekton and became Ascended at the same time as him. While Nasus planned the battles, Renekton was the one to win the battles. When
Xerath
forced his Ascension, both Renekton and Nasus went to stop him and were the only two God-Warriors there. After a fierce battle, Renekton ordered Nasus to close the Tomb of the Emperors. However, the millennia in darkness with Xerath drove Renekton mad, and he forgot his own sacrifice, being led to believe Nasus had betrayed and abandoned him to his fate. Having now escaped, Renekton is hunting down Nasus in hopes of getting his revenge.

Azir
[

Renekton spent eons battling Xerath within the tomb of the emperors. During this time, Xerath manipulated his slowing breaking his mind to turn him against his brother
Nasus
.
Saikhal
, Xerath's birthplace, was conquered by Renekton. Xerath was likely taken as a child slave at that time.
