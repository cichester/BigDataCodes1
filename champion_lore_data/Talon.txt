Early life
[
edit

edit source
]

Talon has no recollection of his family, nor of any warmth or kindness. He scraped out a living through his quick wits and deft thievery in the underbelly of Noxus. He learned to navigate the underground passages of Noxus and attained mastery of the blade. Marked as a threat by the empire, assassins were sent after him. He managed to kill his pursuers, dropping their bodies into Noxus’ moat.
However, when
General Du Couteau
himself came after Talon, the Noxian General emerged victorious in the duel. He made an offer to Talon – to die or serve the Noxian High Command. Talon chose to live on the condition that he would serve the General alone because he could only respect orders from those he could not defeat.

Katarina

At some point Marcus du Couteau tasked Talon with helping him fake his death, without anyone knowing. For years he secretly worked with the General who promised to make him his heir after fulfilling his mission. To achieve that, he got closer to Katarina, pretending to be a good brother. After Katarina was captured by Marcus and tasked to kill king Jarvan III, she returned back to Noxus only to find Talon welcoming her back. Having realized Talon knew about Marcus this entire time, she fought with him and won, injuring his eye.

Appearance

Talon is a fair-skinned human man with dark hair and brown eyes. He is usually seen dressed as an assassin, with nearly his full body covered in blue cloth and light metal armor. This outfit features a large hood that shrouds his face and a decorative "cape" composed of five blades dangling from red ribbons. He also sometimes covers his nose and mouth with a cloth mask. His signature weapon is a large silver blade strapped to his right forearm.

Personality
[

Talon is a cold and deadly perfectionist, valuing swift and clean kills above all else. He is obedient and efficient in his tasks, but despite his generally merciless approach, Talon believes his methodology is the best for all parties involved. In Talon's words, it's more merciful to give targets a quick, painless death than to draw it out, and it is both safer and more efficient for an assassin to avoid combat when possible. If a clean kill is not delivered immediately, Talon already considers that to be failure.
Talon is shown to deeply value his family, taking on their name and greatly respecting Marcus and House Du Couteau. However, Talon's admiration and obedience to his father ultimately leads him down the path of resentment, as Talon desperately works to maintain
Marcus Du Couteau's
approval and comes to view himself as the rightful heir. Because of this,
Katarina
sees Talon as a younger version of herself - someone who has lost his independence to become Marcus' pawn - and pities him for it.

Talon was bested by and consequently served under
General Du Couteau
,
Katarina
and
Cassiopeia's
father. As his protege, Talon was adopted by the general and became his favorite student. Because of this, Talon believed he had earned the family daggers and hoped to become the new heir to House Du Couteau. He is fiercely loyal to his father and his family, treasuring their status over that of
Noxus
itself.

Talon was assigned the task of killing
Katarina
after her first failure by her father,

his assassination failed, which left a scar on her left eye. He decided to bear his failure instead of reattempting, due to the hypocrisy it would be compared to Katarina's case. He named the very blade he used after Katarina, and keeps it in case he is reassigned to kill her. After helping Marcus fake his death, he pretended to be a good brother to her. He hoped to turn her against Swain and instill in her their father's efficient fighting style, only to become frustrated when she would stubbornly refuse take his advice.

When Talon ultimately betrayed her again, he lost the battle again in which Katarina injured his right eye.
