Early Life

Born in
Bandle City
, Rumble was bullied by his fellow yordles when he was younger, making him irritable and scrappy. He found solace in tinkering using discarded junk in the junkyard.
Rumble's teachers recommended him to go to
Heimerdinger
's Yordle Academy of Science and Progress in
Piltover
, but Rumble rejected it, seeing Heimerdinger and his staff as sellouts for wasting the potential of yordle technology for humans. However, this did not stop him from trying to greet Heimerdinger's human students whom had travelled to Bandle City. Unfortunately for him, the interaction culminated in him getting beaten up and hearing how much of an embarrassment he was to "enlightened" yordles like Heimerdinger. The next day, Rumble left Bandle City for several months. He returned with his mech Tristy, that he had constructed from scavenged junk, eager to show what yordle technology was capable of.

Main article:
Shuriman Trash

Disguising himself as an elderly merchant, Rumble visited
Nashramae
,
Shurima
to purchase wares from the other merchants. His cart was bumped into by a Shuriman cripple named Anaktu, whom was being bullied by the governor's stepson Kesu Rance and his friends. Initially indifferent towards Anaktu, Rumble took offense when Kesu began insulting him as well. He walked to his stall to activate Tristy in order to intimidate the bullies, but the mech began to malfunction, causing the bullies to attack the mech and taunt Rumble. Anaktu grabbed a mace from Rumble's stall to defend him, before swinging it at the bullies. As Kesu was about to attack him, Rumble came to Anaktu's defense with an
electrified harpoon
. Warming up to Anaktu, Rumble invited him to ride on his mech, letting him activate the
flamespitter
and inviting him to watch his
Equalizer
fire its rockets, barring off Kesu's escape route. Anaktu asked Kesu why he was bullying him, with the latter confessing he wanted to impress his Noxian father. With Rumble's glamour expiring, the yordle threatened Kesu with a harpoon, demanding him to apologize to him. Kesu tried to apologise for his bullying, but Rumble told him that he disrespected junk and how it had so much potential. After Kesu dumbfoundedly apologized, Rumble decided to return to Bandle City. Anaktu offered to return his mace, but Rumble let him keep it out of respect towards his appreciation of junk.
