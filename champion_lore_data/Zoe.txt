As the embodiment of mischief, imagination, and change, Zoe is a very mischievous and imaginative girl. She enjoys playing tricks on mortals and has an endless imagination. While she's seen as a threat by humans, Zoe is, in actuality, very friendly and tries to make friends with whoever she can. However, she still won't hesitate to fight back against those who threaten her, as shown when she threw a meteor at several enraged guards who tried to attack her. She's also incredibly bubbly and perky, having incredibly high levels of energy all the time.

The previous Aspect of Twilight, Myisha, led the
Darkin
Ta'anari to
Nasus
, who guided them to the Chalicar, the blade that belonged to the Ascended queen Setaka and belongs to
Sivir
in the present day. Ta'anari used the weapon to perform a ritual that reverted the Ascension of the nearby Darkins, vaporizing them. She and other Targonian Aspects later gave the mortals the tool to trap the remaining Darkins. As a result, the Darkins, who are now roaming free again, especially
Aatrox
, despise every Aspect and their host, most noticeably The Aspect of Twilight/Zoe.
