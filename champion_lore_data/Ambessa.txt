Youth

Ambessa was born in
Rokrund
to the
Medarda
family, one of the
Great Houses
of
Noxus
. Her parents trained her from a young age in the Medarda family code, and raised her on stories of her ancestor, Eskender. She received her first steel sword when she was five, and was awestruck when they took her to watch the battles in the
Reckoner
arenas where warriors fought for a chance at glory. When she was ten, she got to see death up close when her father brought her to collect the weapons of the fallen in the aftermath of the Battle of Hildenard. Ambessa's father died not long after the battle, and her older brother Hanek was cast out of the clan for cowardice when he tried to flee from enemy forces. To make up for her son's error, Ambessa's mother sent Ambessa to live with her grandfather, the feared clan patriarch Menelik, to undergo rigorous instruction under the his tutelage. By the time she was fifteen, Ambessa was already a promising warrior on the battlefield, and she wore her first uniform with pride.
During her training, Ambessa became close with her cousins Ta'Fik and Zoya, who were siblings also being trained under Menelik. When they were young they had always promised to protect one another; yet, when the day came to prove themselves the Medarda trial of strength, Ambessa abandoned her allies to capture a
drakehound
matriarch—a decision that led directly to Zoya's death. Although Ambessa's feat won her Menelik's favor, Ta'Fik never forgave Ambessa for leaving his sister to die. Ambessa threw herself into the celebrations to escape her guilt, and as the praise from her family grew, so too did Ambessa's ambition.

Early Adulthood
[
edit
|
edit source
]

In celebration of her victory, Ambessa was gifted command of the drakehound pups from the matriarch's litter, and she trained the two strongest—Quench and Temper—to serve as her faithful companions. When she reached adulthood, Ambessa was gifted her first warships and she began to lead her own soldiers. She started to commission her very own Reckoner Arenas, beginning with a pit in Rokrund where she could scout and recruit fighters into her elite warband, the Wolf's Reapers. One of the first that caught her eye was
Rictus
, a formidable warrior whose strength she deemed far too valuable to not be used on the battlefield. Ambessa immediately bought out Rictus's debts, and he swore himself to her, quickly rising to become her second-in-command. Their partnership would last decades, with Rictus continuing to serve and protect Ambessa long after he had already fought off his dues.
At the clan's behest, Ambessa entered an arranged marriage with a particularly talented merchant named
Azizi
, whose skills were deemed invaluable to protecting the family's finances and trade. Before long, Ambessa and Azizi had a son,
Kino
. As she held her son in her arms for the first time, Ambessa learned what it was like to love unconditionally, but as the years passed, she was dismayed that Kino did not possess the heart of a warrior. Soon after this, Ambessa became pregnant with a second child when she fell in love with a
Targonian
dancer named
Rudo
while passing through the port city of
Basilich
. When they were alone, Rudo confided in Ambessa that he was part of a secret cabal of mages known as the
Black Rose
, and he swore to keep his distance from her so that their child would remain hidden from his master, the
pale woman
. Ambessa didn't see or hear from Rudo for many years, but the memory of him always lingered in the back of her mind.

Blood Sweat & Tears

Ambessa returned to Rokrund so that her child could be born in their family's ancestral home. When she was close to giving birth, however, their city was attacked by Raxii raiders from the
Varju Mountains
. Ambessa fought and was gravely wounded during the battle with an arrow to the stomach. As she lay dying, Ambessa was visited by a harbinger of the
Kindred
, who showed her visions in
Volrachnun
of her past and future. After passing Kindred's trials in combat and sacrifice, she was granted a vision with two possible destinies: She could return to the realm of the living, and if she was strong enough, she could claim a throne through might and bloodshed. Or, she could take her place now in the realm of heroes beside
the Shield
and lead the hunt of the chosen in the Eternal Chase. Before she could make her decision, however, Ambessa felt contractions from her pregnancy and awoke in the realm of the living, uncertain if what she had seen was truly real. She returned to Rokrund Citadel a changed woman, steeling her worldview towards ambition, glory, and sacrifice—the virtues taught to her by the
Wolf
. Ambessa gave birth to her daughter,
Mel
, and began working towards her perceived destiny.

Raising a Successor
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Ambessa was protective of her children, but believed they were sheltered and spoiled by Azizi, who raised them while Ambessa was off fighting battles for the family. Kino and Menelik were known to have a poor relationship, and in time, Ambessa fully wrote him off as a possible heir, opting instead to ready Mel for this position. From a young age, Mel displayed promising political acumen. To prepare her for the cutthroat world of Noxian politics, Ambessa took Mel on a tour to meet the leaders of the important Noxian cities, including the
Immortal Bastion
, where they got to see Grand General
Boram Darkwill
from a distance.
[

]
Ambessa also introduced Mel to the Reckoner Arenas to learn the virtues of sacrifice, as they watched the mighty
Alistar
crush each of his opponents in the Noxidi Arena.
[
4
]
During this time, Ambessa continued to scout Reckoners for her Wolf's Reapers, with a young horse rider named
Rell Canwell
quickly becoming one of her favorite fighters. Mel was not receptive to Ambessa's teachings in the arena, however, nor did she enjoy watching what she considered a "blood sport." In time, Ambessa grew frustrated by how soft her daughter had grown up to be.
When Mel was fifteen, Ambessa took her on a campaign in the jungles near
Kumangra
, where she conquered an estate owned by the
Ionian
Binan family and freed a number of
vastayan
rebels from their dungeons. At this time, Ambessa received word that Menelik had been wounded during a campaign in
Bel'zhun
, and realizing he would soon be forced to name a successor, Ambessa decided it was time to name hers as well. As a test for her daughter, Ambessa brought the Binan leader,
Lady Mion
, hoping that Mel would have the strength to order the prisoner's execution. To her disappointment, Mel suggested showing the prisoner mercy. After explaining why this was a foolish notion, Ambessa beheaded Lady Mion with her katar, and she returned to Bel'zhun without having named an heir.

Ambessa: Chosen of the Wolf

Death of Menelik
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ambessa visited Menelik on his deathbed in
Bel'zhun
, where he told her he had been visited by
Kindred
and received a vision that foretold the fall of
House Medarda
. According to the dream, this future would only be prevented with a strong leader at the head of the clan, and although Ambessa promised to prevent their house's fall, Menelik said he needed more time before he was ready to announce his decision. The next morning, Menelik was found dead in his sleep. All the Hostlord's closest allies and relatives gathered round him, and after bidding her grandfather a silent goodbye, Ambessa declared to the room that she would carry on his legacy as the family's matriarch. Ta'Fik, still bitter about Zoya's death, rebuked Ambessa's claim to the succession, accusing her of poisoning Menelik the previous night. Ambessa was outraged by Ta'Fik's accusation, but despite her innocence, she had no evidence to prove it to other members of their house. As Ta'Fik began to rally his allies against Ambessa, she quickly soon realized her life was in danger and fled the city; but not before supplying the Suns of Bel'zhun rebel group with black powder weapons to sabotage Ta'Fik in her absence.

Journey to the Capital
[
edit
|
edit source
]

On her flagship, the
Golden Dancer
, Ambessa took with her several notable figures:
Rictus
, the
vastayan
rebel leader Caprian from the Binan palace, and
Rell
, who was recruited from the arena shortly before their departure. They set sail for the
Immortal Bastion
in hopes that
Boram Darkwill
would support Ambessa's claim in the line of succession, as Caprian held vital information about
Ionia
that could help the Grand General in planning his long-awaited invasion. Unfortunately, this plan was hindered by a blockade by
Trannit
, as the forces of Steward Smik—a close ally of Ta'Fik—sank their ships and captured Ambessa and her soldiers. Ambessa managed to escape Smik's grasp with just Rictus, Rell, and Caprian in tow, leaving the rest of her soldiers behind. For two months, they made a harrowing journey across the mountains of the
Great Barrier
—living off rabbits and fending off wild
drakehounds
—until they were rescued by a
Vindoran
scouting party, who finally brought them to the city in the north. Steward Amenesce of Vindor was initially neutral in the conflict between Ambessa and Ta'Fik, but after her harbor was blockaded by ships from Trannit and
Fallgren
, she declared her full support for Ambessa. Ambessa and Amenesce rode the rest of the way to Darkwill on
swifthorns
so they would make it in time for his tribute.

Tribute to Darkwill
[
edit
|
edit source
]

When they finally made it to the Immortal Bastion, Ambessa found Ta'Fik waiting for them under the protection of Hanek, who refused to let them fight for as long as they were in his home. After a week of preparation and a narrowly-avoided attempt on Caprian's life, Ambessa managed to deliver the vastaya to Darkwill at his palace ball. Though the Grand General did not promise any immediate support, he was pleased enough that onlookers noticed and wondered what it was Ambessa had given him. Shortly after this, Ambessa received word that Ta'Fik had sent his forces to attack
Rokrund
. Ambessa and her allies rode on swifthorns to the
Varju Mountain
pass, where she ambushed and killed Smik, whose army had been riding to intercept them.

Defense of Rokrund
[
edit
|
edit source
]

After another arduous journey through the mountains, Ambessa regrouped with her warbands in Rokrund, where Captain Burnside informed her that Ta'Fik's soldiers—led by his eldest daughter Gintara—were unnaturally strong, and had used their
enhanced strength
to capture the Rokrund saltpetre mines. To secure their resources, Ambessa led an offensive against Gintara's warband, only to find herself quickly overwhelmed. When Ambessa and Rell were about to be killed by Gintara's
basilisk
, Rell suddenly screamed, and all the steel in the area became heavier and began to vibrate. The basilisk's armor collapsed in on itself, crushing the creature to death and allowing them the chance to retreat. As Ambessa recovered from her wounds, she assessed the shortcomings of the first battle in preparation for the next. Gintara's "rune-soldiers" would certainly attack Rokrund Citadel, so for their defense, Ambessa incorporated what they learned into a plan to capture her. Rictus had discovered a weakness in the soldiers, whose runes would make them collapse if they overexerted themselves. Rell had discovered something else: She had innate
magical
abilities that allowed her to manipulate metal. Rell's new powers convinced Ambessa that she could be a possible successor, and she made plans to adopt her so that she could one day lead the clan alongside
Mel
and
Kino
.
Ambessa's plan to capture Gintara succeeded, but her forces suffered major casualties. To make matters worse, Ambessa's brother Katye delivered terrible news in the citadel: Her husband
Azizi
was dead in Bel'zhun. Enraged, Ambessa decided to make Ta'Fik pay in blood, beginning with his eldest daughter, whom she had executed by Rell's hand. After this, Ambessa gifted Rell a Medarda ring and intended to take Rell to Mel and Kino in Bel'zhun so she could fully welcome her into their family, but the girl vanished without a trace—kidnapped by a
shapeshifter
who had been wearing Ambessa's face. In the absence of any leads, Ambessa and Rictus forged ahead to
Tereshni
to confront Ta'Fik in his palace, taking a ship to Bel'zhun to hold Ta'Fik's youngest daughter for ransom.

Confrontation in Tereshni
[
edit
|
edit source
]

As they were crossing the Conqueror's Channel, Ambessa and Rictus were joined by
Rudo
, who had stowed away on their ship with information about Ta'Fik's forces, as well as the steward's ongoing partnership with the
Black Rose
. Rudo told them about the horrific experiments of Ta'Fik's advisor Inyene, who was working on a project called
"magical transference"
that left numerous kidnapped subjects in catatonic states as
Null
. Rudo believed Rell was being held in Inyene's laboratory in the desert south of Tereshni. Ambessa made plans to defeat Ta'Fik first, then to rescue her young protégé.
At
Bel'zhun
, Ambessa reunited with her children after months apart. Like her, they had both been devastated by Azizi's death, and were currently investigating to find the culprits. Kino, having allied with the Suns of Bel'zhun, had discovered evidence leading him to the Black Rose. To protect Kino, Ambessa ordered her son to immediately end this investigation, but he disobeyed her, determined to learn the truth about his father's murder. Meanwhile, Mel had also made some new friends in her mother's absence, one of which was Ta'Fik's daughter, Tivadar. Ambessa had been planning to take Tivadar hostage and did not believe she could be trusted, but gave Mel one chance to convince her to their side. After Mel told Tivadar, she fled to avoid being captured, and Ambessa was severely disappointed in Mel for letting her get away. Before she left Kino and Mel, Ambessa received a letter from Darkwill, which told her that Caprian had proven useful, and he lent her a fleet and admiral ready at her command. Ambessa ordered the admiral to attack Ta'Fik's warships in Tereshni and those en route to Rokrund before taking her group across the desert.
Ambessa, Rictus, and Rudo rode to
Tereshni
where they found Tivadar, who offered to help them talk her father down from his invasion of Rokrund, at Mel's request. Ambessa used Tivadar's knowledge of the palace layout to engineer a trap to confront Ta'Fik and end his life, hiding her plan from the girl until they were all inside Ta'Fik's home. As Rudo dealt with Inyene and the rune-soldiers, Ambessa caught Ta'Fik in the
drakehound
kennels that housed the escape route from his study. After a heated and bitter duel, Ambessa stood victorious over Ta'Fik and his daughter, who wept over her father's body. Fearing she may have made an enemy of the girl, Ambessa killed Tivadar as well, ending his bloodline. She buried them both in the traditional
Noxian
fashion. After this, she issued a withdrawal of Ta'Fik's troops, as she made plans to reward everyone who had helped her become the clan leader, and to "deal with" all who had opposed her succession.

Feud with the Black Rose

Aftermath of the War
[
edit

edit source
]

With both Inyene and Rudo gone, Ambessa and
Rictus
rushed to the
Black Rose
laboratory to rescue
Rell
. They found it empty save for Inyene's research notes, which they burned in a pyre in the desert. There, Ambessa encountered the pale woman,
LeBlanc
, who claimed that Ambessa's efforts had done little to stop her, and that if she couldn't control
House Medarda
, she would simply destroy it instead. The harrowing confrontation left Ambessa vengeful and paranoid about the cabal's influence, and when she returned to
Bel'zhun
, she made plans at once to send
Mel
away on a ship to
Piltover
, where magic was outlawed and the cabal was unlikely to have a foothold. In their last conversation, Mel confronted Ambessa for killing Tivadar, and though Ambessa argued it was a necessary loss, the look in her daughter's eyes made her question if she had made the right decision. Even so, Ambessa followed through with her original plan, accusing Mel of harboring weakness that was unbecoming of the family and exiling her to live with the "soft-spined idealists" of Piltover. Mel was utterly heartbroken by Ambessa's decision, but she held the course to prevent Mel from ever wanting to return to
Noxus
again. Ambessa allowed Mel to say goodbye to her
brother
and to choose
one person
in Bel'zhun to accompany her on the voyage.
[

Mel left on a ship to meet
Jago Medarda
, and Ambessa didn't see her again for over a decade.

Death of Kino
[
edit

edit source
]

Ambessa's feud with the Black Rose continued for many years after the death of Ta'Fik. As Ambessa continued to lose allies and territory, she became increasingly desperate to uproot the cabal once and for all.
[
6
]
Kino
became deeply entangled in the Black Rose's web while investigating the death of his
father
,
[

]
and he uncovered evidence in
Basilich
which revealed Ambessa's affair with Rudo decades prior. Kino's discovery won him the attention of
LeBlanc
, who abducted him, believing he was the child Ambessa and Rudo had hidden away. It became quickly apparent that Kino was not Rudo's child, and when Ambessa left Kino to die instead of saving him, LeBlanc killed him. Ambessa swore to avenge her son, but with no allies left that she could turn to, she was forced to set sail for Piltover to meet with Mel.

Arcane

Arrival in the Gilded City
[

Ambessa and
Rictus
in
Piltover
.

Ambessa sent a letter to
Mel
and later met her at the docks in
Piltover
, under the guise that she was there to provide guidance regarding the city's ongoing conflict with
Zaun
. It was here that Ambessa informed Mel of
Kino's
death, and she later tried to convince both Mel and the city's de facto leader and inventor of
hextech
,
Jayce Talis
, to develop and use hextech weapons against the undercity. Mel refused her mother's wishes and convinced the Council to avoid an all-out war, but Jayce was swayed enough to attack one of
Silco's
shimmer
factories.
[
8
]
Realizing her mother was behind Jayce's actions, Mel confronted her, and Ambessa finally confessed that she needed a war to happen to ensure that hextech weapons were developed, which would help her to defeat Kino's killer. She asked Mel to let the war happen, after which she would be welcomed back home and at her side. Mel would ultimately turn down her mother's offer, defacing her painting of Noxus and removing her ring with the family crest. With Mel's support, the Council would soon approve Jayce's peace deal with Silco, but the meeting was swiftly cut short by
Jinx's
terrorist attack, which left most of the Council members either dead or seriously injured.
[
9
]
Ambessa rushed to the scene as soon as she heard, and was relieved to find that Mel was completely unharmed.
With half of the Council dead, Ambessa became an advisor to its remaining members, especially
Salo
, who felt a reignited hatred for the undercity after the attack left him paralyzed from the waist down. To consolidate power, Ambessa secretly orchestrated another terrorist attack by manipulating the
chembaron
Renni
, who still wanted revenge against Jayce for killing her son during the raid. Ambessa's soldiers then put down the attack and killed Renni, and the city became increasingly reliant on her warband for defense. After moving underground for safety, Ambessa's attention fell upon
Caitlyn Kiramman
, who after the death of her mother was out for a vengeance against Silco's remaining forces, especially Jinx. Ambessa was most interested in the fact that Caitlyn was able to use her family name to seize control of the
Piltover Enforcers
and barge into a closed Council meeting unannounced, and Ambessa realized she could take advantage of the
Kiramman Clan
's influence for her own ends.
[
10
]

Martial Law Period
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Piltover remained under martial law for the following months, with Caitlyn remaining little more than a figurehead for Ambessa's rule. Ambessa eventually learned about her daughter's disappearance, as well as the disappearances of Jayce and all the other leading experts in hextech, and she tried without success to weaponize the gemstones without their help. Ambessa suspected the Black Rose was behind everything and became paranoid, sending her soldiers to crack down on and occupy large portions of Zaun as she pushed Caitlyn to pursue Jinx,
[
6
]
while training and molding her in the Noxian principles.
[
11
]
After acquiring information about where Jinx's supporters would be gathered, Ambessa sent
Rictus
to invade their rally and had them all captured and sent to Stillwater Hold. Shortly after Ambessa had left Stillwater, she was suddenly attacked by
Warwick
, a bloodthirsty chemtech beast who left a massive claw mark on her battle mask before breaking into and going on a rampage through the prison.
[
12
]

A New Chemweapon
[
edit
|
edit source
]


After Warwick's attack, all the prisoners were gone except for one: a mysterious doctor known only as
Singed
. Ambessa and Caitlyn quickly deduced that he was the culprit behind the attack, as well as the beast's creator, but he would not crack during their interrogation. Intrigued by Singed's beast, Ambessa decided his knowledge and weapons could prove a valuable asset and recruited him into her army. Ambessa would later learn from Caitlyn that Singed's true identity was Doctor Reveck, a disgraced Piltovan alchemist who was responsible for numerous untold atrocities. Under threat, the doctor explained that his life's work was a "cure to death" which he could use to revive his daughter
Orianna
, and that he believed Warwick held the final key to completing it.
[
2
]
On Ambessa's orders, Singed developed a device that would let him track down his beast, which Ambessa would use as both a weapon and a scientific specimen for Singed to complete his research, so that she could have access to this "cure" for her own purposes.
[
11
]
[
13
]
Ambessa and Singed tracked Warwick to the undercity, where they found a massive
commune
led by a "Herald," whom Singed deduced was an old pupil of his named
Viktor
. The doctor left to negotiate Warwick's return, and when the negotiations failed, Ambessa learned that Viktor was attempting to restore the beast's sanity, which would remove his savagery and make him useless to her. To prevent Viktor's success, Ambessa sent Singed to inject Warwick with a serum that would erase his human memories, and had Caitlyn accompany him, as she had recently captured
Vi
near the commune. With Caitlyn gone for the time being, Ambessa attempted to kill Vi, as she believed her absence had made Caitlyn easier to manipulate. However, Vi suddenly escaped from her bonds and trapped Ambessa in a
net
from Caitlyn's rifle, revealing that Caitlyn had already switched sides. Ambessa eventually came to and got free from the net, and she arrived at the commune just in time to see Warwick murder Rictus right in front of her. Enraged, Ambessa commanded her forces to attack Warwick, burning everything to the ground.
[
11
]
After the battle, Ambessa ordered Singed to treat her injured soldiers. He was unable to save Rictus, so Ambessa buried him along with the rest of the dead. Viktor and his followers had also been debilitated during the attack, and even Warwick, who was similarly wounded and unresponsive after the battle, was entirely useless to her as a weapon in this state, even though they had recaptured him. Ambessa declared her intent to avenge Rictus, and angrily demanded the "cure to death" that Singed had promised. The doctor replied that he had the means to such a cure, but it depended on Viktor's survival.

Battle at the Hexgate
[
edit
|
edit source
]

When the Herald awoke, Ambessa realized he had to power to command his followers as puppets to his "
Glorious Evolution
" and could transform them into hextech soldiers utterly obedient to his will. Viktor said he was too weak to reach an "Anomaly" that festered beneath the Hexgate, and too injured to defeat any defense Jayce would raise against him. Ambessa offered to make a deal with Viktor, stating that she could take him to the Hexgate, and in return he would "evolve" as many of her soldiers as she wished. Viktor later agreed to the deal, and Singed transformed him using Warwick's blood, raising the Herald and his followers to their final forms. Ambessa was pleased with the power she had discovered, believing she was soon to acquire an army that need never fear death.
[
13
]
Later, Ambessa was relieved to learn that Mel was alive when she arrived to negotiate on Piltover's behalf. Mel had heard of Ambessa's plan to bring Viktor to the Hexgate and hoped to prevent her mother's plans, begging her to spare Piltover as they had nothing to do with her feud. However, Ambessa was set on acquiring her army of evolved soldiers, even if Piltover had to suffer because of it. Mel returned to Piltover, and Ambessa prepared her invasion.
Armed with a
kaenic rookern
as a ward against magic, Ambessa led her assault on the Hexgate, using every resource at her disposal and many layers of deception to make steady progress against Caitlyn's Enforcers. Before the battle, she ordered Singed to enhance a number of her soldiers using
shimmer
. During the assault, she had her army carry Viktor's spherical cocoon into the battle, even though it was already empty. Then, as her forces made their final advance, she ordered
Maddie
to betray the Enforcers at the last moment, turning the tide of the battle in her army's favor. When the dust cleared, Ambessa's Noxians had captured Caitlyn's forces and she ordered Maddie to execute her. However, Caitlyn was saved by Mel, who shielded her from the gunshot, and Jinx, who arrived on a war balloon leading an army of Zaunites who freed Caitlyn's soldiers.
To Ambessa's amusement, the Piltovans managed to destroy Viktor's chrysalis, seeing their shock as they realized it was empty. Shortly after, the arrival of Viktor's puppets undid the Piltovan efforts once again. Ambessa, Caitlyn, and Mel were left surrounded by the Noxian soldiers, separated from the rest of the battle as Viktor's army overran all of her enemies. Feeling her victory at hand, Ambessa ignored her daughter's pleas to recognize the disaster she was about to unleash, believing Mel's weakness was preventing her from seizing the power the lay in front of them. She began in a duel against Caitlyn and Mel, and despite being outnumbered, Ambessa easily gained the upper hand on them and cut out Caitlyn's left eye.

Death and Legacy
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ambessa's arrogance would become her undoing, as while she had been distracted,
Caitlyn
managed to remove her
rookern
, making her vulnerable to magical spells. To Ambessa's horror,
Mel
used a hidden amulet to summon the
pale woman
, who ensnared and fatally-wounded Ambessa within magical thorns while taunting her. Before LeBlanc could do anything else, Mel destroyed the shadowy apparition in a radiant
burst of light
—besting both her enemies through a mix of cunning and mercilessness. As she died in her daughter's arms, Ambessa looked at Mel with pride and declared "You are the Wolf."
After Ambessa's death, Mel would assume command of her warband, taking her battle mask and her ship back to
Noxus
. She wrote her a letter to her mother on the voyage before she landed on the beaches of
Rokrund
, where Ambessa had been taken to
Volrachnun
decades earlier, and she tossed the letter into the waves.

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ambessa is a muscular, brown-skinned woman with light brown eyes. She has coily hair in varying shades of grey to black, worn loosely above the shoulders. She wears
Noxian
styled clothing befitting her rank, mostly made up of black and red colours, with metallic silver elements, and a red cloak with black fur worn to one side. She is shown to have battle scars on her face and upper body, a massive scar on her back given to her by a
basilisk
, and a blade wound on her palm which she inflicted on herself on the orders of her grandfather Menelik.
In her youth, Ambessa's hair was orange-colored and braided all around.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]


As a general of
Noxus
, Ambessa had a prideful and ruthless personality, characterized by her aggression, ambition, and her thirst for legacy. From a young age, she held no aversion to death and in fact admired the strength of those who had sacrificed themselves and others for the sake of glory on the battlefield. Her resolve only strengthened when she encountered the
Wolf
in
Volrachnun
, and she there was soon nothing she would not sacrifice in the pursuit of ways to strengthen the
Medarda
name. Accompanying her ruthlessness was always a brazen indulgence, as she freely enjoyed the decadence of
Piltover
and the "local cuisines" of foreign lands, including their bathhouses, wines, and young male escorts. Ambessa's wrathful demeanor was often counterbalanced by her eloquent sophistication, and while she would often resort to violence, Ambessa was also capable of diplomacy and manipulation to advance her family's interests.
Ambessa was well-versed in military history, citing the death of the Alornian general Sonnem Parlec as a stern warning for the Piltover Council. She was also not above allying with otherwise hostile groups—like
Shuriman
rebels or the
chembarons
—if it helped her to achieve her own ends. While it was not her preferred Noxian principle, Ambessa recognized the usefulness of guile, so long as it does not detract from a show of force. In Ambessa's eyes, it was necessary to be "both the Fox and the Wolf" to achieve greatness, and any failure to accomplish this was seen as weakness that could not be tolerated. As a mother, Ambessa believed herself the protector of her children, and was willing to sacrifice their love for her if she believed it meant keeping them safe. As a veteran soldier, Ambessa was also shown to respect some of her enemies, even her bitter rival Ta'Fik, whom she honored with a Noxian burial after she had killed him in combat.

Abilities
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Skilled Melee Combatant
: Ambessa was a skilled melee combatant. While she was known to wield a katar, her prized weapons of choice were her prized
drakehound gauntlets
; a pair of crescent blades made in the likeness of her pet
drakehounds
, Quench and Temper. Ambessa was able to whip these blades at her foes on lengths of chain, to deadly effect. She also showed excellent reflexes and agility, able to cleanly decapitate someone with one swipe of a blade.
Leadership:
Ambessa demanded absolute loyalty from her soldiers, working to inspire both awe and fear from those who served her. Ambessa was the general of multiple warbands, including the Fists (skilled in close combat), the Shadowhunters (
drakehound
handlers), the Miners (black powder artillery), and the Wolf's Reapers (handpicked from the arenas).
Rell
described Ambessa as a generous and admirable leader, who could also be exacting and cruel when she thought it necessary. Ambessa was always prepared for a betrayal in her ranks and would assign her lieutenant,
Rictus
, to keep an eye on people who worked for her, including
Caitlyn
and
Singed
.
Strategist:
Even as a child, Ambessa would carefully analyze battles by the
Reckoners
to hone her understanding of tactics on the field. Her training carried her to the rank of general, where she used her familiarity with enemy forces and terrain to arrange ambushes and deliver numerous victories.
Naval Commander:
Ambessa was awarded her first warships when she reached adulthood, and she developed a deep love and appreciation for the open sea. Her prized flagship, the
Golden Dancer
, sank in a naval battle against
Trannit
. She is also known to possess another ship, the
Cacklebird
, along with many others.
Statecraft and Diplomacy
: While she was not as gifted a diplomat as her children,
Mel
and
Kino
, Ambessa was skilled at reading others and was able to use this ability to great effect, promising favors to allies and retribution against her enemies. Ambessa's shrewd and tactical nature helped her to become leader of
House Medarda
, besting any rivals who tried to stop her meteoric rise.
Manipulation:
Ambessa was an excellent judge of a person's individual weaknesses, desires, and insecurities, allowing her to manipulate them to her own ends. Often, Ambessa would utilize pawns, like
Renni
and
Salo
, with a series of false promises before discarding them once they outlived their usefulness. Ambessa was also skilled at manipulating people into behaving in ways they normally wouldn't, convincing
Jayce
to develop hextech weapons and convincing
Caitlyn
to enact a brutal occupation of Zaun.
Mentor:
As a master of the battlefield, Ambessa was excellent at passing down her skills in combat onto others, especially those whom she had recruited from the arenas into the Wolf's Reapers. Notably, Ambessa was responsible for mentoring
Rell Canwell
and training
Caitlyn Kiramman
in close combat.
Drakehound
Handler:
When she was nineteen, Ambessa captured a drakehound matriarch and was given the task of handling and training her pups in the
Medarda
kennels. Ambessa became familiar with each of the basic commands, as well as the wild, ferocious nature of the dangerous beasts. This skill helped Ambessa do battle against both enemy drakehound handlers and those in wild packs.

Kaenic Rookern
:
A powerful relic with anti-magic properties, which could be activated by ritual before any battle. It originally belonged to
Rictus
, who inscribed the stones with names of those he defeated in honorable combat.
[

After his death, Ambessa took the rookern from his halberd and vowed to avenge him.

Relations

House Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Ambessa was raised in one of the oldest and most powerful noble houses in all of
Noxus
, and from a young age, she was taught that she was destined for greatness. Ambessa was raised on stories of her ancestor Eskender, the
Shuriman
merchant who guided Noxian travelers throughout the desert until only one remained, before killing him and taking his land and titles for himself. Ambessa believed her family's history to be one of bloodshed, ruthlessness, and cunning, and her interpretation of the Medarda family code laid the foundations for her ambitions and entire worldview. Ambessa wanted more than anything to bring glory to her family name, but in becoming its leader, Ambessa would unintentionally lead her house on the path to ruin, as had been foretold in a vision by her grandfather, Hostlord Menelik.

Mel Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Mel was exiled from
Noxus
after Ambessa accused her of harboring weakness that was unbecoming of their family. Secretly, Ambessa had always admired her daughter's political acumen and had hoped to name Mel as her successor, but she was disturbed by Mel's lack of ruthlessness. Wrath was necessary to survive in Noxian politics, and mercy in her eyes was nothing but a lack of strength. To rectify this, Ambessa began to seek out other candidates who could strengthen Mel, including
Rell
, whom she deemed either a potential bodyguard for her daughter or a possible replacement as heir. Her children were deemed "foxes" among the wolves, and Ambessa believed they needed a wolf who could protect them when she was gone. Ambessa tried many times to instill a killer instinct into Mel by taking her to the
Reckoner
arenas and even giving her the chance to execute
Lady Mion
. To her dismay, Mel took after
Kino
, believing that war was a "failure of statecraft." Although Ambessa loved her daughter, their many arguments led Ambessa to question everything, from how she had treated her children as a parent, and even the Medarda family code. For this, Ambessa came to believe that Mel was making her weak.
Ambessa's feud with the
Black Rose
worsened her relationship with Mel, as her fear of Mel being taken away drove her to cast her out of the family and exile her to
Piltover
. Ambessa told herself she was keeping Mel safe from the
pale woman
, but the event was so traumatic for Mel that she remembered her mother's words for over a decade. When they reunited, Mel received Ambessa coldly and refused to help her to acquire
hextech
weapons to confront
Kino's
killer, even when Ambessa promised she would be welcomed back home. Eventually, Mel uncovered the truth about her mother's deception, but was unable to convince Ambessa to spare Piltover from her feud. During their battle, Mel would defeat Ambessa through a mix of cunning and mercilessness, and Ambessa finally came to respect Mel's strength as she died in her daughter's arms.

Kino Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Although Ambessa was dismissive of Kino's purely diplomatic approach to statecraft, Ambessa cared deeply for him, feeling as though she didn't truly know love until she held him in her arms.
[
15
]
When Kino's
father
was killed in
Bel'zhun
, Ambessa urged him not to investigate the assassination, as the ones responsible,
Black Rose
, were too dangerous for him to defeat alone. Kino disobeyed Ambessa's orders and continued his search,
[
3
]
and in time, he became so entangled in the cabal's web that Ambessa believed there was no longer any hope of saving him. Mel would later accuse Ambessa of leaving Kino to die, which angered Ambessa to such an extent that she slapped her. Ambessa claimed that Kino was "all the sweetness" in her heart, and the Black Rose had taken him because they knew it would emotionally devastate her. Ambessa would try to avenge Kino by seeking out
hextech
, which she would weaponize in order to destroy the ones who killed her son.

Azizi Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Azizi was Ambessa's husband by arranged marriage, and although they had not chosen one another, Ambessa had a deep appreciation for him as the father of her children, despite the fact that she believed he was spoiling them. Azizi would often wait for Ambessa whenever she came home from war, ready to massage and comfort her. Ambessa also trusted and relied on Azizi's mercantile expertise for speaking with
Noxian
stewards, and she left a detachment of the Wolf's Reapers to protect him and her family in her absence. When Ambessa learned about Azizi's death, she was shaken with grief and rage and immediately sought vengeance against Ta'Fik, whom she believed to be responsible for the incident.

Menelik Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ambessa's grandfather, Hostlord Menelik, was the man she deemed responsible for raising her, moreso than her actual parents after her father died and her mother gave her away when she was ten. Under Menelik's instruction, Ambessa underwent grueling training and severe punishments, with Ambessa once being forced to squeeze a steel blade in her hand just to teach her a lesson. Ambessa's hunger for Menelik's approval was strong, and she leapt at every chance she had to impress him, even if it meant sacrificing her comrades. Menelik awarded Ambessa's achievements with celebrations and gifts, including her very first warships. When Menelik lay on his deathbed, Ambessa was certain he would announce her as his successor. Unbeknownst to her, Menelik had chosen Ta'Fik. Ambessa did not learn this until much later from Rudo, and though she kept the information secret, it left her bewildered and disturbed, still wishing for her grandfather's approval even months after his death.

Ta'Fik Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ambessa and Ta'Fik were once close in their youths, being cousins, fellow students of Menelik, and the best of friends. This changed when they reached adulthood, as Ambessa, in her eagerness to prove herself to Menelik, left Ta'Fik and his sister Zoya to fend for themselves as she captured a
drakehound
matriarch. Ambessa did not intend to cause Zoya's death, and though her decision that day haunted her, she never apologized, instead throwing herself into glory and celebrations to escape her guilt. Ta'Fik never forgave Ambessa or Menelik for Zoya's death. He became a steward and she became a general, and the rift between them only grew with time, with it becoming the catalyst that began the Medarda civil war. Others, like Tivadar and Rudo, tried to convince Ambessa and Ta'Fik to forgive each other and end the conflict. They both refused, as the war had already led to the deaths of Ambessa's husband and Ta'Fik's eldest daughter. Ambessa ultimately stabbed Ta'Fik through the heart and gave him a traditional
Noxian
burial next to where she had killed him.
[

Rictus
[
edit
|
edit source
]


When Ambessa began to build her elite warbands, she commissioned many
Reckoner
arenas so she could scout out and recruit powerful fighters across the empire. One of the first warriors she recruited was Rictus, a giant of a man with an unstoppable, unshakeable calm in his fighting style. Believing he was wasted in the arena, Ambessa bought out his debts and allowed Rictus to repay her by fighting in her Wolf's Reapers, where he quickly rose to the rank of her second-in-command. When Rictus had fully repaid his dues, he chose to continue serving her, and she grew to trust him as the strongest and most loyal soldier in her army. Rictus refused any titles Ambessa tried to give him, making clear many times that his only wish was to be her bodyguard. As Rictus accompanied her everywhere for decades, Ambessa eventually considered him her best friend, as well as the only one she could trust with her closely guarded secrets, including
Mel's
true nature and her feud with the
Black Rose
.
[
3
]
After Ambessa successfully took control of
Piltover
, Rictus was a brutal supporter of her and
Caitlyn's
regime, as well as a co-conspirator in Ambessa's plot to declare martial law. His death at the hands of
Warwick
enraged Ambessa to such an extent that she invaded and destroyed
Viktor's
entire commune. Ambessa would then ask
Singed
to save Rictus' life, but his injuries were far too severe. At Rictus's burial, Ambessa decided not to mourn his death but instead to avenge it, as she planned her full-scale invasion of Piltover.

Rudo
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ambessa was utterly enchanted by the
Targonian
dancer she met in
Basilich
, and when they spoke for the first time, they both saw it as a means to escape from who they truly were. In Rudo's case, he was an agent of the
Black Rose
, a mage living a double life who could never be free from the
LeBlanc's
grasp. Both Ambessa and Rudo tried to hide the cruelty they were capable of from the other, instead allowing themselves to be someone new. When Ambessa became pregnant with their child, she and Rudo made an agreement to keep their distance in order to protect
Mel
from being taken by the cabal. Dreams about Rudo would linger in her mind, however, and when she learned he had met with Mel in
Bel'zhun
, she tried to look for him, but found no one.
When Rudo finally left the Black Rose and reunited with Ambessa, she treated him harshly, partially due to the stress of recent events, but also because she distrusted him, as the Black Rose was both actively supporting Ta'Fik and was also behind the kidnapping of
Rell
. Slowly, Ambessa began to warm up to him, and they even rekindled their past romance. After Ambessa confided in Rudo the sins of her past, however, Rudo confessed to being the one who killed Menelik—which he had done to prevent Menelik from announcing Ta'Fik as his heir. While Rudo claimed to have done this for Ambessa, she felt heartbroken and betrayed by the information, making him leave her room for the rest of the night. The next day, Rudo sacrificed himself to defeat Inyene and the rune-soldiers, and to keep his daughter's secret safe. Ambessa later mourned him in the desert, regretting the terrible things she had said to him the night before his death.

Black Rose
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ambessa first learned of the Black Rose after she fell in love with Rudo in
Basilich
, where he confided in her about his double life as a member of the secret order. Ambessa feared for years that the
pale woman
Rudo served would find and take away her daughter,
Mel
, if they were to even find out she was Rudo's child. During the
Medarda
civil war, her paranoia was amplified as she slowly realized the Black Rose was behind everything—supporting Ta'Fik, kidnapping
Rell
, assassinating
Azizi
, even spying on her as she ran simple errands in the
Immortal Bastion
. After defeating Ta'Fik and burning Inyene's research in the deserts of
Tereshni
, Ambessa's feud with the Rose went into full swing as she and LeBlanc openly declared war on one another. To protect Mel from the feud, Ambessa had her sent away to
Piltover
, where she believed the mages of the Black Rose were unlikely to have a foothold.
Ambessa's feud with the Black Rose cost her nearly everything, including the life of her firstborn son,
Kino
. After she had been stripped of most of her holdings, Ambessa became desperate and fled to Piltover to seek out
hextech
weapons to defeat the Rose once and for all. LeBlanc in turn sent an assassin,
Amara
, to kill Ambessa, and when this failed, she kidnapped Mel to be recruited against Ambessa. LeBlanc ultimately won her feud against Ambessa, ending her life on the steps leading up to the Hexgate, but failed to fully convince Mel over to their side.

Kindred
[
edit
|
edit source
]

When Ambessa was gravely wounded at the battlefield of
Rokrund
, a lone
Wolf
approached her, whom she recognized as a harbinger of the Kindred. As she was on the brink of death, Kindred took Ambessa to
Volrachnun
and gave her two tests. The first was a test of combat against
the Shield
. The second was a test of will and sacrifice. For passing her trials, Ambessa was rewarded a vision of her sitting on the throne of the
Noxian
empire, which she could claim should she choose to return to the realm of the living.
[
3
]
Ambessa's meeting with the Kindred alloyed her resolve and ambition, and she would make it her personal mantra to always be as fearsome and merciless as the Wolf.
[

]

Rell Canwell
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Rell was one of the many
Reckoners
scouted out by Ambessa in the arenas who were eventually recruited to join her elite warband, the Wolf's Reapers. Ambessa watched Rell's rise for an entire year until she defeated the arena's champion in
Bel'zhun
; an event which nearly coincided with Menelik's death and the start of the
Medarda
civil war. As Ambessa made plans to flee the city, she decided to take Rell with her, to the chagrin of the Canwells used their daughter's prize money as a source of income. Rell, on the other hand, was simply excited to get away from her parents. On the journey, Ambessa and
Rictus
became Rell's mentors, training her in matters of survival as they crossed the
Great Barrier
. In time, Ambessa came to care for Rell as one of her own, taking her shopping in the
capital
, warning her about romantic "entanglements," and rushing to protect Rell whenever she was in danger. At the defense of
Rokrund
, Ambessa felt a deep pride and appreciation when she saw how much Rell had grown under her instruction. Rell, in turn, came to regard the general with a mix of fear and admiration, and she worked hard to prove herself to Ambessa while worrying about disappointing her.
When Rell's powers of ferromancy were discovered, Ambessa became interested in weaponizing Rell's new abilities, though she tried to hide this and repeatedly told herself that Rell was more than just a weapon to her. After Rell passed the same test Ambessa had given
Mel
with
Lady Mion
—in which Rell personally executed the prisoner in question—Ambessa offered to adopt her as one of her children so that she could help Mel and
Kino
to lead the Medarda clan one day, and although Rell hesitated, she accepted on the condition that Ambessa would continue to train her. Before the decision could be made official, however, Rell was abducted by the
Black Rose
, which marked the beginning of a decades-long feud. Ambessa promised herself she would rescue Rell, but she found Inyene's desert laboratory empty.

Boram Darkwill
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ambessa claimed that Grand General Darkwill was a difficult man to read. Secretly, Ambessa did not truly respect him, believing the grandiose image he cultivated for himself was just a mask for a man who had never truly been to war, and she was unnerved by the numerous veterans he left abandoned in tents on the outskirts of the
capital
. Even so, Ambessa recognized the importance of Darkwill's favor, as she needed his support if she hoped to succeed Menelik as leader of
House Medarda
. For months, she raced from
Bel'zhun
to the capital so she could make it to his tribute in time, where she presented him with a
vastaya
, Caprian, who held vital information that could help him plan his invasion of
Ionia
. As a reward for her efforts, Darkwill later sent a fleet with an admiral to Ambessa's aid, which proved instrumental in preventing the fall of
Rokrund
to Ta'Fik's reinforcements.
[

]

Piltover
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ambessa had little respect for the gilded city. Although she found the Sun Gates a useful means to transport her warships,
[
3
]
she considered Piltover to be a backwater city full of "soft-spined idealists" and resented having been forced there to avoid the
Black Rose
's influence. Despite this opinion, Ambessa recognized Piltover as a place where several of her important interests lay. During the reign of
Boram Darkwill
, she had an active spy network in the region to monitor the Grand General's debts on the canal,
[
3
]
and after the discovery of
hextech
, Ambessa traveled to the city personally to help spur its weaponization. Councilor
Jayce Talis
met with Ambessa briefly after her arrival, and she successfully manipulated him into acting impulsively against
Zaun
. After
Jinx's
bombing of the Council chamber, Ambessa also manipulated
Salo
to help her take over the Piltovan government by declaring martial law. Her activities culminated in a full-scale invasion of Piltover's Hexgate, where Ambessa would finally meet her end.
[
14
]

Caitlyn Kiramman
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Caitlyn served as the leader of
Piltover
while it was under martial law, but was in practice a puppet of Ambessa's
Noxians
. Ambessa manipulated Caitlyn by urging her to seek vengeance for her mother's death, and sometimes warned Caitlyn about the dangers of "professional entanglements" when it came to
Maddie
, who was both Caitlyn's lover at the time and a Noxian.
[
16
]
Ambessa later mocked Caitlyn for not heeding her advice, as Maddie would ultimately sabotage Caitlyn's forces at a critical moment by betraying Piltover. Ambessa would also join Caitlyn in some of her interrogations, and also trained Caitlyn on her warships while teaching her the Noxian principles, as they would directly collaborate during their hunt for Jinx. However, there was a lack of trust between them and Caitlyn would eventually turn on Ambessa to work with
Vi
instead.
Ambessa and Caitlyn would meet again on the battlefield, with Caitlyn defending the city alongside Mel. While Caitlyn would lose an eye in the encounter, her efforts would lead directly to Ambessa's death as she stole Ambessa's
kaenic rookern
, which had been protecting her against the
Black Rose
's magic.

Singed
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Ambessa met Singed in Stillwater Hold, where he had let himself get captured as his beast,
Warwick
, ran rampant throughout the dungeon. Singed would not crack under Caitlyn's interrogations, so Ambessa tried a different approach by recruiting Singed as an advisor, having been impressed by Warwick's potential as a new chemweapon. Ambessa would later learn Singed's true identity as the disgraced alchemist Doctor Reveck, the inventor of
shimmer
, and he explained his life's work was to find a cure to death for his daughter,
Orianna
. This cure depended on Warwick, so they set out to track and capture him. When Warwick killed Ambessa's lieutenant,
Rictus
, Singed tried to save his life at Ambessa's request, but his injuries were too severe.
Singed's efforts led not just to the capture of Warwick, but the capture of
Viktor
as well, who had recently evolved into a Herald in the undercity. Ambessa took an interest in Viktor's evolved puppets, and Singed assisted in completing the full transformation of Viktor and his followers to aid her assault on
Piltover
. Singed would also provide Ambessa with massive soldiers empowered by shimmer, suggesting that he continued to serve Ambessa up until her death.
