Early Existence

Born at the beginning of creation, Aurelion Sol and his kin were alive for eons before
Runeterra
even existed. They wandered through the early universe, seeking to fill it with wonders. Aurelion Sol's passion was creating stars; he forged systems and galaxies as he traveled. He rarely met any equals in power and stayed away from the Aspects, who were egotistical and uninterested in creation, instead focusing on their own philosophies.

Betrayal and Detainment
[

When Aurelion Sol returned to one of his earliest creations, he was surprised to see that there was a world orbiting it, a planet he had not formed. The Aspects seemed invested in this world, Runeterra, where crude civilizations had sprung up. They urged him to come closer and guide the inhabitants. Flattered by the opportunity to have his glory praised, Aurelion Sol descended upon Mount Targon, taking the form of a cosmic dragon. The Targonians named him
Sol,
after their sun, and the Aspects demanded they make him a gift to thank him for it. This came in the form of a golden crown, which they offered to him.
As soon as it touched him, though, it became clear that this was no gift. The crown attached to its head, etched with magic so powerful that even he could not remove it. It restricted his powers and placed him firmly in the control of the Aspects. Aurelion Sol realized what was happening, but before he could retaliate, he was thrown back into space and prevented from coming near Runeterra. With Aurelion Sol at their command, the Aspects channeled his powers into a massive Sun Disc that the mortals had made. Using his energy, they raised up mortals into god-warriors, and when the first Sun Disc fell, a more powerful one took its place. Aurelion Sol was forced to watch as these
Ascended
destroyed first their enemies, then Void-creatures, and finally themselves.
The stars he had created began to fade because of neglect, but he was still unable to free himself and help them. The Aspects ferried him between different planets to complete tasks for them, not realizing that the crown's bonds were slowly weakening. Aurelion Sol decided that when he escaped, he would take revenge on the Aspects and destroy Runeterra for detaining him, and finally got the chance when a series of magical cataclysms rendered the planet almost defenceless.

Twin Dawns

Aurelion Sol was called back to Runeterra by a previous incarnation of
Pantheon
, the Aspect of War. As always, he appeared in the sky as a glowing comet, invoking various reactions and emotions from the people below. As he witnessed the people react to him in ways he had seen before, Aurelion Sol thought about how humans never learned from their mistakes and how circular the pattern of history is. He scoffed at the primitive nature of the people below, hearing their names for him, and deeming them all incorrect, believing that these lowly creatures could never understand what he truly was.


When he arrived on the mountain on which Pantheon was waiting for him, the Aspect ordered him to seal a breach into
The Void
that had formed in the mountain. However, Aurelion Sol did not immediately obey, managing to unease the Aspect. Eventually, he was forced to obey the Pantheon, and he destroyed some of the the various energies and Voidborn creatures that emerged from the rift. However, he was not able to seal the rift, as there was a sentient being keeping it open. Aurelion Sol felt the energy eminating from the rift and realized that this being was laughing at him.
Infuriated, Aurelion Sol formed three
fledgling stars
out of the elements around him and threw all three at the rift. The stars seared the abyss closed, with an explosion so massive that it destroyed the mountain that the rift had formed on and everything on it, along with Pantheon's physical form. Across Runeterra, mortals saw what many called a 'second dawn', caused by the light that was released by the explosion.
Aurelion Sol had killed Pantheon's physical form, he had disobeyed orders from the Aspects themselves, and the cost of such insubordination was the life of a star, which physically and emotionally hurt him. His fury that a sun was the cost of an Aspect's physical form was tempered by the knowledge that he had learned from the Aspects' mistakes once again. From across the universe, the Aspects rushed to direct him somewhere else. As he left Runeterra, Aurelion Sol sensed that a new host - possibly
Atreus
- was chosen to bear the spirit of Pantheon. As he took pleasure in the confusion and desperation he sensed from the Aspects, Aurelion Sol left Runeterra, knowing that the Aspects were afraid of what he might do next.

The Spear of Targon

Aurelion Sol has been called back to Runeterra, though it is unclear for what purpose. Moreover, he has summoned
6
Inviolus Vox
to the planet, to await the time when dragons across the universe shall descend upon Runeterra.

Appearance
[

edit source
]

While most cannot see or even comprehend his true form, Aurelion Sol takes the form of a cosmic dragon when not in the
celestial realm
. In this form, he is larger than even Mount Targon, Runeterra's tallest mountain. His skin is dark blue, resembling the color of deep space, and glistens with the light of stars. He glows in this form in light and dark shades of blue, and his head is white with sharp spikes resembling teeth around his mouth. What could be considered his hair is a deep purple and dark blue, and attached to his head is a golden crown.

Personality
[

edit source
]

Aurelion Sol is an arrogant and prideful celestial being. He is angry at the Aspects for imprisoning him and is determined to destroy Runeterra. He is impatient and irritable and is extremely dismissive of Aspects (apart from
Zoe
) and anybody that he sees as inferior to him. Made bitter by his imprisonment, perhaps the only things that Aurelion Sol cares about are the stars he has created.

Celestial Magic:
Aurelion Sol is closely attuned to the Celestial Realm and has access to its magic, allowing him to create and manipulate the cosmos to his will. Unfortunately, these powers are strongly nullified by the golden crown given to him by the

drag entire stars down
to crush his opponents.

Leona
and
Diana
[

Aurelion Sol has disdain for both the Solari and Lunari, and by extension Leona and Diana. This is because he sees their divisions as pointless, since moonlight is merely reflected sunlight.

Zoe
[

Aurelion Sol and Zoe are well-acquainted. She is the only Targonian Aspect that appears to offer him aid and protection from the Aspects' wrath. However, he often gets frustrated by her childish behavior and her insistence on him being her pet 'space doggy'.
