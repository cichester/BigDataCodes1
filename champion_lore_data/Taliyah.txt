Early Life

Taliyah was born in the south of Shurima, near the border of Icathia. Her tribe, the Naasaj, were nomadic weavers and herders. Though Taliyah was always taught to appreciate the desert's beauty, she was always most interested in the rock that lay underneath.
After she turned six, Taliyah set off to find a young goat her father - the master shepherd and tribe chief - had placed in her hands. She followed the goatling through the night to a sheer cliff where it had become stuck. The stone of the cliff called to her as she lay a hand upon it, then erupted, bringing both goat and canyon wall down upon her. Her father brought her back to the camp and put her under the care of Babajan, the tribe's grandmother. Days later, she was finally able to explain what had happened, how the stone had called to her, but didn't mention that she had allowed it to fall. Babajan concluded that the Great Weaver watched over Taliyah, telling her parents that there was no reason to worry.
Once a child came of age in the Naasaj tribe, they performed a dance under the full moon - the face of the Great Weaver - to determine what their path in life would be based on their talents, and to apprentice them to a teacher. Taliyah, believing her power to be a curse, watched others use their own skills. When her time to dance finally came, she did not choose to become a weaver like her mother or herder like her father, instead closing her eyes and dancing with the stone. It rose up from the earth in a pillar, evoking startled cries from her kin. Her will broken, the rock crashed to the ground, cutting Taliyah's mother as she rushed to protect her daughter. To Taliyah, this was proof that she was indeed dangerous to everyone around her, and so she ran out into the night.
Her father found her eventually, and Taliyah finally admitted her ability to shape the stone. Instead of being scared or revolted, though, he told her that she needed to face her power, not run from it. She returned to the circle with open eyes. This time, she wove with purpose, creating a memory of those she loved. When it was time for her mentor to stand, the entire tribe did, ready to stand with her. But Taliyah knew that her true teacher was not among them, and so she headed out into the world, promising to learn to control her power.

The Bird and the Branch

By now in her mid-teens, Taliyah headed west towards
Targon
, drawn towards the mountain by her natural affinity for stone. However, while in northern Shurima, it was a band of
Noxians
who discovered her. They promised her that Noxus celebrated such power, that she would find a teacher there. Raised to be trusting, Taliyah followed them, into the heart of Noxus. The endless political games were claustrophobic to her, until one captain promised to take her to
Ionia
, a place where she could practise her magic freely. But when they docked near a village and she was told to bury the inhabitants in their homes, Taliyah refused, and was tossed overboard to drown, which gave her a lifelong fear of drowning.
After escaping the Noxians, Taliyah came across
Yasuo
, meditating in a shrine. She accidentally brought down an avalanche upon him, but managed to save him and bring him to a cave. He asked her why she had chosen such a path, causing her to leave the cave in frustration. While outside, Taliyah came face-to-face with an Ionian mountain lion. Learning a lesson from a little bird, Taliyah leaned into her power and crumbled the rock beneath both her and the lion. Yasuo saved her, becoming her unlikely mentor in the process. They had another harrowing encounter when some soldiers found them in an inn, accusing Yasuo of murder. With Taliyah's help, he fended them off and they escaped. Not long afterwards, they parted ways, but not before Yasuo told Taliyah to travel to the
Freljord
.

Homecoming

Taliyah rushing home at the sight of
The Sun Disc

Taliyah returned to Shurima at around 17 years of age, passing through Bel'zhun and stopping in Vekaura. Outside the city, however, she found a dying
Sivir
, and decided to help her before going to find her family. While there, an army led by
Xerath
attacked Vekaura, looking for the heir to Azir's lineage - Sivir - in order to kill her.
Nasus
, who was also looking for Sivir, found them both and gave Sivir an amulet which would keep her hidden from Xerath, before going to fight the rogue Ascended. Taliyah managed to escape Vekaura with Sivir, but also protected Nasus and the survivors of the attack from Xerath's arcane missiles.
While outrunning a sandstorm, Taliyah ended up right outside the Great City of Shurima, which had risen from the sands. She was ushered into the city to escape the sandstorm, which seemed too dangerous to withstand with the old Shuriman traditions. As she rested, she put a hand out to touch a city wall and was suddenly overwhelmed by memories locked within the stone. There was intense pain seared into the rock by tens of thousands of voices, the city's previous citizens. Azir's failed Ascension and Xerath's betrayal had killed all of them, in the same catastrophe which buried the city millennia ago.
Taliyah spent a while in the desert, travelling with a group of other Shurimans whose families or homes had been destroyed by the Void, including
Samir
,
Kadira
and
Zaifa
. She considered them her new family. Her quest to find her tribe was complicated by the fact that the seasonal waters no longer flowed, so she could no longer predict their location. The group had decided to travel north to Xolun, a place they believed would be a safe haven from the Void.

The Call

Kai'Sa meets Taliyah

When she sensed a person travelling underneath the earth, Taliyah resolved to follow and help them if she could. The person turned out to be
Kai'Sa
, who had been tracing a massive tunnel bored into the earth by an unknown voidborn. Taliyah managed to save Kai'Sa from a group of Lamplights, though didn't destroy them, and a pit collapse. They returned to Taliyah's camp to rest and eat, but Kai'Sa left the next day to continue following the tunnel underground, warning that the
Xer'Sai
would stop them before they got to
Xolan
. In fact, their route lay directly above the tunnel, and a little while later it collapsed into a massive pit, taking
Samir
with it. Taliyah got the other travelers to safety before diving in to save Samir. She found him, and helped Kai'Sa defeat the Lamplights using Kai'Sa's
speed
and her
minefield of stone
. Thanks to the other travelers, all three made it out alive. Kai'Sa was angry with Taliyah for not taking her advice earlier and pointed out that if the tunnel aligned with the route to
Xolan
, the town was likely
already destroyed
. Taliyah argued that they had managed to defeat the Lamplights together. They decided to try and reclaim
Xolan
from the Void, and so they parted ways with the group of travelers.
Taliyah and Kai'Sa arrived in
Xolan
to find the town abandoned and destroyed. They were then attacked by a group of
Xer'Sai
, but fended them off before a sinkhole appeared in the ground.
Rek'Sai
emerged from the pit, and Kai'Sa lured her back underground. This allowed Taliyah to bring the statue of Xolaani, the 'faceless god', over the sinkhole to prevent Rek'Sai from re-emerging.

Taliyah wears a red and gold Ionian coat with long sleeves over her lavender tunic, and a golden crown which keeps her hair in place. This crown was lost or destroyed during her travel to Xolun. She has brown eyes, thick eyebrows, light brown hair tied in a ponytail with two protruding strands braided, fringe, and a wide nose.

Personality

Taliyah is a kind, compassionate young woman with a strong will. She is deeply devoted to her homeland and the people in it, dedicating herself to protecting them from both Shuriman and outside threats. Her confidence was bolstered by Yasuo, as he taught her how to control her power over stone.

Abilities

Mage
:
Taliyah was born with natural magical abilities, which can grow the more she trains and expand her knowledge about magic. Her powers were originally out of control until she learned with Yasuo how to master them.
Stone Magic:
Taliyah has a natural affinity for Stone Magic, the magic of the Earth and the elements within it, that allow her to mold the earth with her mind alone. Even as a child, Taliyah had a connection to the rocks around her, collecting and sensing an energy in them. Some years later, with the help of Yasuo, Taliyah's control over the element has grown greatly, allowing her to perform feats of immense power. Having grown up in a tribe of weavers, she moves stone as if she were weaving a tapestry. She can create massive stone structures and walls in an instant,
travel quickly using the stone
, cause quakes of varying size and even partially collapse mountains. Additionally, she can sense to some extent past events locked within the stone.

Athletic abilities:
Taliyah is a skilled dancer, singer and runner.
Multilingual:
Having travelled over much of Shurima and Valoran, Taliyah knows several different languages, including modern Shuriman, conversational and Ur-Noxian, and some Ionian, as well as some ancient Shuriman symbols.

Yasuo became the teacher Taliyah had been looking for, as her people didn't understand her power, and Noxus sought to use her as a weapon. Before parting ways, Taliyah gave Yasuo the thread of handspun Shuriman wool with which he ties his hair back in-game. As an only child, Taliyah sees Yasuo as the older brother she never had.
