Early Life

edit source

Though Diana's true birthplace is unknown, she was found by a group of
Solari
hunters when they discovered her swaddled between her dead parents, both of whom were distant travelers that were claimed by
Mount Targon's
cold temperatures. Discovering that the baby was still alive, the hunters quickly brought her into their temple and dedicated her, raising Diana as a member of the
Rakkor
, also known as the
Tribes of the Last Sun.

Solari Training
[

edit source
]

Like all in the Solari faith, Diana underwent rigorous physical and religious training as a child. She was determined to understand the ways and traditions of the Solari, trying to piece together the reasoning and logic behind their beliefs in the sun. Diana would spend many nights digging through the temple's libraries, relying on the pale moonlight in the night sky to illuminate the texts. Paradoxically, Diana's pursuit for answers brought more questions than answers, as her teachers' vague and aphoristic replies provided her with nothing.
While continuing her search, Diana began to notice that some tomes had entire chapters torn out of them, with all references to the moon seemingly missing from all Solari texts. Questioning the Solari faith lead to Diana facing harsh punishments by her teachers, who scolded her for her doubt in the sun. At the same time, Diana's troublesome relationship with her own instructors lead to even her own fellow acolytes shunning her, causing Diana to grow cold and bitter against her fellow classmates who considered her a strange outsider.
At the age of thirteen, Diana went under the tutelage of priestess Elcinae, who witnessed a massive argument Diana had with a fellow priestess named Nycinde. Despite this, Elcinae saw the potential in Diana's skills in rhetoric and logic and urged her to train her skills in a way that still respects the teachings of the Solari.
The next year, Diana questioned her Oratory class instructor Nemyah on why they call the night "
The Darkness
", arguing that the night is not truly dark and instead lit by a gentler, cooler light in the form of the moon. Because of this, Nemyah demanded she held her tongue and punished her for being disruptive. As punishment, Diana had her speaking privileges revoked from the class. Catching news of this, Elcinae wrote to Diana to urge restraint when questioning the logic of the Solari as well as noting that she would talk with her instructor Nemyah about reinstating her speaking privileges in her Oratory class.

Meeting Leona
[

The day after, Diana's Oratory class discussed the topic of the upcoming Festival of the Nightless Eve, hearing her classmate Sebina's speech about her excitement for her first Nightless Eve. Diana, rightfully annoyed, questioned why
she
was being punished while the rest of her classmates get to discuss pointless topics such as the festival.
Surprisingly, a fellow acolyte named
Leona
, who was known as being the most faithful and dedicated Solari student, volunteered to argue against Sebina by combatting her emotion with a different one. Though it wasn't a very captivating argument, Diana liked her effort nonetheless. On top of that, Leona described the night as
somber
rather than evil, which quickly caught Diana's attention. Continuing off of Leona's statement, Diana began to ask questions about the darkness and state her criticisms of the upcoming festival, which quickly angered Nemyah.
A few days later, Leona passed notes with Diana as the two discussed plans to practice Oratory studies together after their Middle Rakkoric instruction class. Diana questioned why she would ask
her
of all people to help, as she was known to be the class troublemaker, but Leona insisted that she was the most skilled at constructing logical arguments in the class despite her disagreements with their instructors. Along with that, Leona offered to help Diana in return and share some advice of her own if she wanted. Diana, though still suspicious of whether or not this was some kind of joke Leona was trying to play on her, agreed to help since she had no other assignments of her own to work on.
Diana, not wanting to get Leona in trouble for talking to her, decided not to meet in person and instead the two swapped notes with each other. Despite the fact that Leona was extremely faithful to the Solari, Diana admired her bravery and humbleness by approaching her for help. Leona was one of the first few classmates to ever show her some form of kindness and she liked the idea of having someone to talk to, but she questioned why Leona would continue associating with her.
One day, the two swapped notes once more as Diana examined and discussed Leona's arguments for her upcoming presentation, noting that she was definitely improving. However, the two had a slight disagreement on why anything outside of the Sun was considered evil, as Leona was content with accepting it as truth while Diana believed they should dig deeper into the subject. Aside from that, Leona also noticed that Diana hadn't been practicing with her shield and offered to practice with her, which Diana denied as she felt that using a shield was too distracting and weighed her down, noting that she felt well defended as long as she was on Leona's team.
During the presentation, Diana joined in the debate with Leona despite her speaking privileges having been revoked. When her instructor Priestess Nemyah ordered her to be quiet, Diana instead proposed a rebuttal and suggested that not everything belongs to the sun, which was considered blasphemous to the Solari. As punishment, Diana was sentenced to three days of standing in the sun with no shade or water until sunset as a reminder of its merciful judgement.

Festival of the Nightless Eve
[

By the third day of her punishment, Diana was resentful but still didn't completely forsake her Solari faith, though she started questioning whether or not sun even loved her at all as a follower. Though she was punished, she thought the debate she had with Leona during her presentation was worth it as that was the closest they'd have to talking together in public. Though the Festival of the Nightless Eve was coming, Diana planned to instead climb and watch the stars at night, as Leona was the only person she would consider going to the festival with. Diana believed that, because of her low social status and after their public debate, she couldn't possibly want to go to the festival with her.
Leona finally asked Diana if she would attend the Festival of the Nightless Eve with her, but instead told her that she simply won't be attending the festival, which saddened Leona as she questioned why she wouldn't. Diana, resentful from the punishment she endured, accused Leona of simply trying to preach to her, and never seeing her as a real friend. Diana, despite being on the verge of tears, got angry and yelled at Leona as the two got in a very loud, heated argument before being dragged off and reprimanded by Priestess Thalaia, sentenced to scrubbing the floors of the entire temple as punishment. A few days later, Diana came to the realization that Leona wasn't
preaching
to her, but genuinely wanted Diana to attend the festival as her
date,
becoming angry with herself for being so foolish.
One the night of the festival, Diana snuck out of the temple while the other acolytes prepared and dressed up. Climbing above the temple around the lower peaks of the mountain, Diana found a good resting place and sat there, watching the sky as the sun began to set. Once the night sky appeared, Diana, even though she knew it was against the Solari faith, relished in the light of the moon and the night stars, secretly offering a prayer to the moon.
After her silent prayer, Diana heard Leona calling for her from afar. As she approached her, Diana questioned why Leona was up there with her and not down at the festival and asked if someone sent Leona to bring her back to the temple. Leona shook her head and instead apologized for making her upset and getting them both in trouble. Diana insisted that
she
had to apologize instead and the two laughed slightly. While staring at each other under the night sky, the two realized that this was the first time they ever spoke in person with nobody else around to watch them.
Diana offered Leona a spot to sit next to her and the two watched the night sky together, being closer than they ever had before. Diana again asked if she was going to the festival at all as Leona stated she wasn't sure and that it depended on how she felt. As the two watched in silence, Diana laid her head against Leona's shoulder. The two sat there for hours, simply enjoying the view and each other's company. Diana, however, knowing how much the festival meant to her, offered to dance with her back at the temple. Though she expected her to say no, Leona simply stated "not yet" and grabbed her hand, leaning in for a loving kiss before travelling down the mountain to the festival.

For years, Leona and Diana remained as incredibly close friends and lovers. Though the two have their differences in their level of faith to the Solari, they continued to love one another as Diana relished in finally having a true friend among her Solari peers.

Lunar Discovery
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Many years later, Diana continued to question her Solari faith, constantly searching for answers beyond their teachings and seeking to unearth ancient secrets that the Solari seemingly kept hidden for generations. One night, Diana discovered a hidden alcove deep inside the mountain and found images depicting golden warriors with imagery of the sun as well as silver-clad warriors with reflective imagery of the moon, providing evidence of an ancient civilization that once praised the moon the same way the Solari praised the sun.
Diana eagerly raced to share this message with her dear Leona, but she surprisingly reacted harshly and urged Diana to quit her pursuit, warning her of the punishments she'd face for the heresy she unearthed. Diana, having never seen Leona so serious and bleak before, reluctantly promised her that she'd drop the subject. Frustrated, Diana couldn't resist questioning why this discovery was considered heretical against the faith and sought to find out what the Solari were hiding.

Ascending Mount Targon
[
edit

edit source
]

Desperate for answers, Diana decided to sneak out of the temple under the cover of night and ascend Mount Targon itself, hoping to find the answers she seeks at its peak. The climb up the mountain was excruciating, testing her both physically, mentally and even spiritually as she faced vicious trials on her climb. Surprisingly, she found herself able to survive the harsh heights of Mount Targon by focusing on her love for Leona, hoping to find answers that would make the Solari a better, more complete faith.
Once Diana arrived at the summit, she was greeted by the brightest, fullest moon she'd ever seen. In a rapturous moment of power, a pillar of moonlight slammed into her body from the skies as she felt the great presence of an
Aspect
, which has chosen Diana to be its mortal host. As her body bathed in moonlight, Diana saw glimpses of the past in her mind, provided by this Aspect as it slowly took over her consciousness. Through these visions, Diana learned of the
Lunari
; a long lost Rakkor faith that were devout followers of the moon rather than the sun.
Once the light dissipated, Diana regained control of her own mind and emerged as the new host for the
6
Aspect of the Moon
, her once dark hair now gleamed with a bright silver as she found herself clad in silver armor and holding a
crescent blade
. Diana quickly realized she was not alone in this ascension, as Leona stood at her side in a golden set of armor that reflected her own.
Though Diana was overjoyed to share this ascension with her lover, Leona instead demanded that the two of them immediately return to the Solari temple and face the judgement of the priests. Diana begged Leona not to, instead urging her to come with her so that the two can face a new future together, to which Leona refused. Their disagreement increased dramatically as the two eventually engaged in swift combat with one another, erupting into a flurry of moonlight and sunfire. Though Diana had her blade at Leona's throat for a moment, she refused to strike the killing blow and instead feared that she was losing herself to the powers of her new Aspect, choosing to flee down the mountain instead.

Attacking the Solari
[

Vindicated in her search, Diana decided to confront the Solari for their incorrect teachings, wishing to show them the errors of their ways. As she arrived at the Solari temple, Diana easily pushed back the
Ra'Horak
guardians and burst into the chambers of the Solari high priests. While Diana explained the discoveries she found and the visions she saw of the Lunari, she was denounced as a heretic, blasphemer and a peddler of false gods, sentencing her to punishment for her heresy. Upon this, Diana felt a rage amplified by the Aspect within and decided to embrace it in a terrible
burst of moonlight
, instantly obliterating the high priests and many surrounding Solari. Startled by this sudden and uncontrolled display of powers, Diana fled the temple.

Modern History
[

Following visions and memories of the Aspect within her, Diana sought to follow these visions as a means to find the answers she had always been looking for, believing that she had a larger purpose beyond the Solari. Though she's still unsure what these visions are leading her to, she remains resolute to seek out her answers no matter the cost.

Encounter with Voidborn
[

]

One night, her visions lead her to a dark forest filled with massive, ancient trees and foliage. Having grown up on the mountain ranges of Targon, she had never seen such verdant forests before. After thanking the Aspect of the Moon for her guidance, Diana found overgrown, withered trees up the slopes of some rocky highlands. After passing through these trees, Diana found a circle of towering stones carved with spirals and curving sigils, noticing that each stone had the same moon-shaped rune that appeared on her forehead. Moving to the center of the mysterious structures, Diana drew her crescent blade and knelt down with her head bowed down before sensing the arrival of three terrifying
Voidborn
.
Diana brutally and hastily fought the creatures, slashing at their ivory flesh as their bone-white carapaces quickly darkened a deep purple upon exposure to
Runeterra's
atmosphere. While fighting off the creatures, Diana felt a deep hatred from within her, seeing visions granted by her Aspect that showed a
terrible war
that was once waged against these monsters. Diana soon unleashed the full might of her Aspect and got lost in visions of a great city that once stood in this forest, summoning a striking beam of moonlight that split the clouds and empowered the stone structures that surrounded her before obliterating the Voidborn and closing the Void Rift that stood nearby.
After that, Diana returned to her normal conscious self and successfully sealed the rift. However, she knew that her work was not finished and went onward to continue her quest in following the Aspect of the Moon.

Confronting Leona
[

edit source

At some point, Diana returned to Mount Targon and found a large majority of Lunari followers emerging out of hiding, inspired by her arrival as the new Aspect of the Moon and seeking to fight back the oppressiveness of the Solari.
When a Lunari Shadestalker named
2
Lyra
was captured by the Solari, her mentor
5
Cygnus
gathered several Lunari warriors to save her including Diana herself. Lyra, having fallen in love with a Solari boy, was able to escape herself and Diana saw the two of them fleeing the Solari soldiers at a cliff known as Dragon's Roost. Unfortunately, Lyra was killed when an arrow struck her in the chest as she tried protecting her Solari lover. At that moment, Diana witnessed the moon eclipse the sun, illuminating the edge of Dragon's Roost and allowing the two to ascend into the heavens, turning them into celestial constellations that depicted their love.
As the Solari soldiers headed back to the tribe, Diana saw Leona for the first time in years leading the Solari soldiers. Though she initially held her weapon up as a threat, she slowly lowered it when Leona noticed her from afar, silently agreeing to not fight this day as the two stared at each other longingly before going their separate ways.

Over the years, the two would clash with one another in small skirmishes, as Leona continuously tried to convince Diana to let go of her connection to the moon while Diana continued her search for answers through the Aspect's visions. Eventually, the two Aspects prepared to fully face one another in combat. As Diana stood among her Lunari followers, they gave her prayers of protection for the upcoming battle and coated her weapon in
1
Duskpetal Dust
. On the day of the battle, Diana raced down the mountain's peak with the intention of catching Leona's attention, drawing her into a position where she'd get the upper-hand.

Return of the Ruined King

Diana at some point returned to Targon to look for any trace of the Lunari; on her way she encountered the sentinels of light. Diana volunteers to guide them up Mount Targon. To fight off the threats of the Ruination, the Sentinels recruit new members, which includes
Diana
, turning her into
Sentinel Diana
; she attains
a new uniform and a relic sword by Gwen.
After the Sentinels take down Viego, every recently recruited Sentinel lays down their Sentinel weapons and cloaks to return to their regular lives.

Appearance
[

edit source
]

Diana is an incredibly slender woman with pale white skin and eyes the color of lavender. Though her hair was initially black as the night sky, it quickly turned into a striking silver color when she ascended as an
Aspect Host
. Now as an Aspect, Diana bears a glowing white sigil of the Lunari on her forehead which acts a symbol of her celestial powers. AS makeup, Diana has striking dark eyeshadow along with black lines that vertically cross her eyes. She dons dark blue clothing with bright silver armor plates on her shoulders, forearms and breastplate. Her entire outfit is adorned with crescent shaped accessories and details that are customary of the
Lunari
. Diana's signature moonsilver blade is bright silver, crescent shaped and glows a deep ethereal blue when she activates her abilities.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Diana as a child was a quite rebellious and undisciplined girl since many times she did not obey the rules of the Solari and that led her to isolate herself from everyone, the only person who understood her was
Leona
whom she always treated with respect, with time the two became best friends and eventually lovers.
Diana was also quite curious and she was more curious about the moon and the Lunari tribe whom the Solari looked upon with hatred and abhorrence.
After becoming the Aspect of the Moon, Diana tried to convince Leona to leave Mount Targon together. However Leona only wanted to return to the Solari. This disagreement soon turned into a titanic battle. Diana chose to flee rather than strike down her only friend and lover. Diana is driven by the idea that the Solari and Lunari were close once bfore, and could be again. In recent times she has dedicated herself to guiding the Lunari and helping them to move forward.
Because she does not fully control her Aspect powers, Diana can cause great destruction when she explodes in anger, which causes her powers and emotions to go out of control.
