Early life

The only child of
Grena
, the matriarchal chieftain of the tiny Avarosan tribe, Ashe is
Iceborn
: a member of the warrior caste, gifted with an ancestral connection to the magic of her lands, and the rare ability to wield the power of
True Ice
. Everyone assumed that Ashe would follow her mother as the tribe's next leader. However, this was never a glory Ashe desired. The grim responsibility of her warlike lineage and extraordinary gifts instead left Ashe feeling isolated, burdened, and alone.
Her only respite was when
Sejuani
, an Iceborn girl from a sister tribe, would stay with them for the summer hunts around the
Ornnkaal Rocks
. The girls' friendship defined their childhoods, but was cut short just as they reached their teens. Somehow, Grena had offended Sejuani's grandmother, and the fellowship between their tribes ended suddenly.
Soon after, with her youth fading, Ashe's mother began her lifelong quest for the “Throne of Avarosa”, a supposed hoard of treasures and magical items that she hoped would return her people to greatness.
But Grena’s belief in prophecies and legends led her to take risks, which often left her tribe enfeebled. Finally, during a dangerous and unnecessary raid in another tribe's lands, Grena was killed. Her sudden death left young Ashe on the run, while most of her tribe was wiped out.
Alone, pursued, Ashe followed her mother's last map to a deserted glacier where she found the supposed grave of Avarosa, and her magical bow of True Ice. Ashe used the weapon to avenge her mother's death, then turned west.
Whether it was out of duty or loneliness, Ashe gained a reputation by protecting the many scattered hearthbound tribes she encountered. She spurned the custom of taking thralls, and instead chose to adopt these desperate people as full members of her new tribe, and her fame grew quickly. Soon many began to believe that she did not just carry the weapon of Avarosa—Ashe
was
the legend herself, reborn and destined to reunite the Freljord.
But tall tales would not feed her followers, and their long march south left the tribe on the verge of starvation. So, Ashe leveraged the myths surrounding her, using them to form alliances with the powerful and land-rich southern tribes, promising to unite them into a nation capable of challenging neighboring kingdoms.
These new alliances brought new dangers, and Ashe quickly found herself at the center of a political feud. A Warmother, as Freljordian tribal leaders are known, was expected to wed, and taking a husband from one of the major tribes would anger the others. Ashe could take several husbands, but this would only bring the conflict to a boil within her own household, and the ensuing bloodshed would shatter the alliances she had fought to build.
Her answer was an impoverished vagabond from a mountain clan that had been nearly wiped out—the warrior
Tryndamere
. He was neither a spirit-walker nor blessed with any elemental powers, but upon his arrival in Ashe’s new capital, Tryndamere had thrown himself into every dueling ring he could find. He fought with abandon, desperate to prove the destitute survivors of his clan were worthy of adoption by one of the stronger tribes. But even for the Freljord, his brutal fighting style and extraordinary vitality were unsettling, and many suspected he was touched by dark magic. Ignoring this, Ashe offered to adopt his people as her own, if he became her first and only bloodsworn.
Tryndamere accepted reluctantly. Though a political marriage, the attraction they felt for each other was palpable, and slowly a true affection blossomed.

Ashe is a slender, pale-skinned woman with blue eyes and long white hair. She wears light, elegant robes with a distinct palette of black, dark blue, and gold. She also wields a
Avarosa's True Ice Bow
.

Personality

edit source

Ashe is smart, stoic, serene and has a calm disposition. She is idealistic as well, believing that by retaking their ancient, tribal lands once more will unite the Freljord.
However, Ashe is implied to have a heated temper and vengeful streak, especially to those who have hurt her allies in the past. Her rage is so intense that she relies on the stinging cold of True Ice to keep her calm.

Abilities

]

Iceborn Physiology
:
Ashe is one of the Iceborn, individuals with a magical alteration to their bodies that makes them inherently resistant to the cold. Because of these resistances, Ashe is capable of wielding
True Ice
, a magical material that constantly freezes and never melts.
Bow Proficiency:
Ashe is extremely talented in the art of archery since childhood, capable of firing arrows with extreme precision at far distances. She currently wields a magical bow made of True Ice, believed to have been previously wielded by the revered
Freljordian
goddess Avarosa. Using this bow, Ashe can summon
frost arrows
as ammunition, capable of completely
freezing
her enemies in an instant.
Leadership:
As the current Warmother of the Avarosans, Ashe is a formidable leader and successfully leads the Avarosans on their mission for a newly united and modernized Freljord.
Diplomacy Mastery:
Unlike the rest of the Freljord, Ashe focuses primarily on diplomatic relationships and has become well versed in all manners of negotiation and modern politics. With this, she has successfully made the
Avarosans
one of the largest tribes in the Freljord thanks to the many alliances made on Ashe's behalf.

Ashe and
Sejuani
were childhood friends but were separated when Ashe's mother offended Sejuani's grandmother about how she was raising Sejuani. They were eventually reunited as teenagers after Ashe's tribe was decimated by
Lissandra's
frost priests, but the two had a falling out during a raid against a neighbor of the Winter's Claw. These neighbors, whom Ashe did not want to kill, would later become the first members of the new Avarosans. The two once saw each other as sisters.

Trundle

Legends of Runeterra
cards suggest Ashe's Avarosan and
Trundle's
trolls
are in direct conflict which has resulted in a number of loss for the tribe. For that reason, Ashe wants the race to be exterminated.

Anivia
[

Anivia
is the demigod that Ashe prays to the most and the one she has the deepest connection to. This is because she speaks the most to Ashe's hopes and beliefs.

Rumors say a recently hatched Anivia has met Ashe, and perhaps Anivia sees one who may be able to finally reunite the Freljord.

Nunu
and
Willump

It is unknown if
Nunu
and
Willump
support Ashe, but their deeds around the Freljord lead towards the same goal.

Tryndamere
[

edit source
]

Ashe
and
Tryndamere
are
Bloodsworn
, a political marriage, but the two eventually developed genuine affection for each other. Ashe originally married Tryndamere in order to avoid having to marry multiple suitors from neighboring tribes. All of this is, in turn, an inside reference at Riot. The name of Riot's co-founder
Marc 'Tryndamere' Merrill
's wife is
Ashley
.

Lissandra
[

Unbeknownst to all,
Lissandra
is the Ice Witch of Freljordian legend, who is actually waiting for the right moment to strike Ashe's and Sejuani's tribes and wipe out any potential incarnations of Avarosa and Serylda in order to take over the Freljord. As revealed by
Lissandra
, she herself is one of the Three Sisters who led the Iceborn uprising against the Watchers. Whether or not she knows Ashe and
Sejuani
are potentially direct descendants of her sisters (Avarosa and Serylda, respectively) making her their great-aunt-many-times-removed, is unknown.
