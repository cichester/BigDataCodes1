Early Life
[

edit source

Centuries before the present day, Elise was born to
House Kythera
, which was one of the oldest bloodlines in
Noxus
. When she came of age, Elise was able to manipulate her way into a beneficial political marriage to Berholdt of the much more powerful
House Zaavan
, elevating her own status at Zaavan's expense. Elise's influence continued to grow with time, and it did not go unnoticed by the shadowy forces secretly controlling the empire, nor by her ever more resentful husband, Berholdt.
Jealous of his wife's influence, Berholdt poisoned Elise's wine at the dinner table before demanding she withdraw from society and relinquish her power back to him, the head of their house. Since Berholdt had the poison's antidote, Elise made a show of remorse and begged for his forgiveness, and when he let his guard down, she took a knife from the table and stabbed him through the heart. Elise took the antidote, but the poison's effect was potent, leaving her bedridden and near death for weeks.
During this time, the mysterious Pale Woman
LeBlanc
approached Elise, revealing the truth about the power behind the Noxian houses and how they were controlled by a secret society called the
Black Rose
. Berholdt, who had been a pawn in their ranks, was now dead, and since Elise was now leader of Houses Kythera and Zaavan, she would have to take his place as a member of the cabal or risk being removed. Elise saw the Pale Woman's offer as an opportunity to acquire ever more power, and over time, she rose through their ranks, using her cunning and wealth to trounce her rivals and persuade others to do her bidding.

Transformation

After some time serving as a member of the Black Rose, Elise heard rumors that the skull of an ancient warlord named
Sahn-Uzal
had been hidden long ago on the
Shadow Isles
. To gain the matron's favor, Elise took a ship with several acolytes to the cursed city of
Helia
, venturing deep through the Black Mist and into the city's depths in search of the artifact.
Elise and her servants avoided the undead spirits, but as they navigated the depths, they were suddenly ambushed by an enormous creature from a long-forgotten past known as
Vilemaw
, the Spider God. Vilemaw devoured Elise's crew and sank his fangs into Elise's shoulder, using his venom to enact a violent transformation throughout her body. Several arachnoid legs ripped out from her spine, and when the pain of her transformation subsided, she saw her new master looming above her, and without a word, she understood what he wished from her. She left the
twisted treeline
and sailed back to Noxus alone, returning to her human shape.
Although Elise hadn't found what she had been looking for, the Pale Woman saw an opportunity in her new abilities, which had given the Black Rose a means to travel freely between Noxus and the Shadow Isles. They struck an accord so that Elise would bring as many unwitting sacrifices as Vilemaw desired, and in return, Elise would be free to recover any ancient artifacts from the ruins of Helia to bring back to Noxus.

Main article:
The Shuttered Manse

One day, a
Shuriman
thief called No-Face Nyam was hired by a powerful man to steal an artifact Elise had collected for LeBlanc, and he broke into the empty, quiet manse of House Zaavan. Elise was waiting for him in the library, and during their altercation, Nyam accidentally broke the cursed hourglass, unleashing a
6
Soulgorger
into the room. Elise and Nyam briefly joined forces so they could escape to safety, and she injected him with some of her venom so they could defeat the monster together. After Elise imprisoned the spirits once again, Nyam was relieved that they had both survived, feeling a newfound devotion to Lady Elise. However, Elise believed the hourglass was not a strong enough vessel, so she killed Nyam and sealed the spirits inside his bleached skull, which she then delivered to LeBlanc in exchange for more suitors to sacrifice.

Masque of the Black Rose

With the rise of the new Grand General, Elise received instructions to invite a number of notable figures to her home, the manor of House Kythera. Among these were the heroic
Jarro Lightfeather
, the
Zaunite
entrepreneur
Renata Glasc
, and the fearless Desert Rose
Samira
. The matron also hoped that
Vladimir
would attend the masquerade ball, as she had need of his boldness for her new plan.
The Silken Danse, however, would be infiltrated by
Katarina
, who, on orders from an unknown individual, attended the ball in disguise to assassinate an unknown target. Elise attempted to defend the man and fought Katarina, but Katarina successfully slit her target's throat.

Appearance
[

edit source
]

Elise is described as a woman of striking beauty. Her human appearance is charming and seductive, designed to attract her victims. She has sharp, defined facial features, dark eyes, and short, dark, slicked-back hair with a distinctive scarlet red sweep along the middle. She usually wears a black cape with scarlet red details, cinched with a cross-like brooch that resembles fangs. Beneath this facade however, she is a monstrous spider-hybrid.
In her spider form, Elise turns to crawl and develops multiple limbs that emerge from her back, maintaining her size but discarding all human proportions. Her skin transforms into a dark, furry, bloated mass with vivid patterns as predator coloration. Although she can fully transform into a spider, she also has an intermediate state in which she maintains a human face, torso and posture, but she assumes quasi-arachnoid characteristics, such as her extremities terminating in pointed edges and additional segmented limbs.

Personality
[

]

Elise is manipulative, cunning and cruel; from a young age, she discovered how to use her beauty to influence others. After her transformation, her abilities to seduce and deceive improved drastically. She often uses charm and the promise of power or ecstasy to lure her victims into her deadly web, enjoying the control she exercises over them. Although she is completely devoted to
Vilemaw
, Elise is pragmatic, and she uses her alliance with the
Black Rose
to ensure a constant supply of victims. Despite her monstrous coldness, her human desires—a need for power and eternal youth—motivate her actions.
