Karma is an ancient spirit of
Ionia
which has guided the Ionian people for many generations, taking the form of many human incarnations throughout history. One known incarnation, Jakgri, had to leave his lover Watai in order to take on his duties as Karma. After his death, the collective spirit of Karma moved on to its current host: Darha, a girl who was raised in
Shon-Xan
and carried
Kathkani
ancestry. At the age of twelve, she began to see visions of memories that weren't hers, and she tried to resist the visions at first before she could no longer handle them. Sent to rest at a healing hut, Darha recognized a group of monks from the Lasting Altar who visited her village to search for the next reincarnation of Karma. Just as they prepared to leave unsuccessful, Darha ran to them, crying to them about her visions and recognizing their voices from her visions. The monks realized that Darha's visions were the result of Karma's past lives moving on to their next vessel, so they adopted her as the new Karma. Leaving her old life behind, Darha was taught how to connect and communicate with the past lives of Karma, and adopted the traditional philosophy of promoting peace and harmony while leaving acts of evil to await their own consequences. But in spite of these teachings, Darha felt confliction of these philosophies, to the confusion of her followers.
When the forces of
Noxus
invaded Ionia, Karma felt the true horrors of war as millions of Ionians were slaughtered by the Noxians. The voices within Karma told her to remain at the Lasting Altar and handle the conflict peacefully, but an even bigger urge to take action swelled in her. Feeling agonized by her internal conflict, Karma stood up and headed out to act. She confronted a Noxian commander on his war frigate by blasting him with divine energy, destroying the ship and killing many of the crew members.
The Ionian civilians cheered for Karma's victory, but the monks believed that she had misused her power and went against everything the spirit of Karma stood for, bringing dishonor to her past lives. Karma interrupted with a raised hand, with the spirit of Ionia intervening to defend itself when necessary. She realized that the true way to keep harmony was to accept that the world was changing rather than ignoring it. As the Ionians ended up stirring into conflict as a result of the war, Karma dedicated herself to guiding her people to peace, while condoning action to be taken when necessary.

Remember Me

Many years after the death of Jakgri, his lover Watai visited the Lasting Altar to receive Karma's healing after being damaged by a fall. Karma healed her leg, but Watai felt contempt towards her due to her pain towards Jakgri's death. Karma admitted to her guilt towards her involvement in the Noxian conflct and being unable to apologize to the people whose lives were ruined by the war, but had no regrets for acting upon Ionia's will to fight back. Watai showed Karma her ring which Jakgri had given her, where the two had to be separated due to having to live their lives far away from each other. Suddenly, Karma's eyes glowed the same color that Jakgri's had when he was Karma. Watai began to tear up, emotional towards the possibility of Jakgri's soul still being in there. Karma told her that he was now a part of the avatar's shared mind, and Watai started to resign to the thought that he had a new life to live. Suddenly, Karma was taken over by the collective spirits, whom reassured Watai that Jakgri loved her until the end and he wanted her to keep her ring. Watai thanked Karma for allowing him to come back, but Karma thanked her since Jakgri's voice had become silent for a long time after the war, but it was she who brought him back. Karma invited Watai to stay at the Lasting Altar for a few more days so they could both heal. By the end of the period, Jakgri's spirit became a part of Karma again, and Watai left knowing that not even death could stop the two's love for each other.

Rise of the Sentinels

When the
Ruined King
returned to the world of Runeterra, he resumed his search for his fallen queen. He would unleash harrowings across Runeterra in search of the fragments of her soul. Karma would defend the Lasting Altar against one of these Harrowings, but was nearly overwhelmed and corrupted by the king. The Harrowing would subside, when Viego obtained a soul fragment from
Senna
, but Karma would be left influenced by the king's magic. Karma would eventually come into possession of one of the fetters of Queen Isolde's soul, a silver flower.
The King would soon continue his search, with aid from his Yordle companion,
Vex
, by unleashing a global Harrowing, spreading Black Mist across Runeterra. The
Sentinels of Light
would arrive in Ionia in search of the fragment and were guided to the Lasting Altar by
Irelia
. Karma proposed hiding the fetter within an ancient Vastayan groves, guarded by ancient magics that not even the Black Mist could penetrate. As they prepared to leave, they would be ambushed by an army of Mistwalkers, the Sentinels and Irelia would hold off the ghouls while Karma fled towards the grove.
The Sentinels would catch up to Karma and they escorted her towards the grove, she began to express regret at not having done more during the Noxian invasion. Karma's regret caused her become susceptible to the influence of the Black Magic and she began to become ruined. Now under the sway of the Ruined King, she would attempt to flee with the fetter, but the Sentinels intercepted her. They manage to incapacite and momentarily purify her, she then reveals the King's plan, to use the fragments of the queen's soul to resurrect her. They are soon spotted by another hoard of ghouls, Karma gives the Sentinels the fetter and tells them to leave her as she succumbs to the Black Mist again. Karma would then become fully corrupted by the Black Mist and become an agent of Viego.
She and
Draven
would accompany the Ruined King to Shurima to search for another fetter. She, alongside the other corrupted champions, would face off against the Sentinels of Light when they mounted their final assault against the Shadow Isles. Viego would resurrect Isolde, but would be to rest again by
Akshan
and his Absolver. The Sentinels imprisoned Viego within Hallow Mist in Camavor. With Viego defeated, his corruption would subside and Karma and others would be free from the Ruined King's influence.

Karma is a tall, slim and curvaceous young woman with light brown skin, a triangular face, short brown hair with a braid at the front on each side, and purple eyes. Her eyes are emerald green in some depictions, possibly related to the flux of exceedingly high levels of spiritual energy during important moments. She has a distinctive line of makeup under each of her eyes, wears dark red lipstick, dark eye shadow, and earrings.
Her formal attire is a tight purple vest, a white corset on top, and a long, purple cape that consists of numerous pieces of free-flowing cloth. These garments are fastened by a waistband on top of the corset. Her left leg is exposed—and marked by streaks of energy flow—but she wears a thigh-high stocking on her right leg. The cape piece includes swirling symbols of spiritual magic at their ends. Shoulder pads and wrist plates cover her arms, the former being decorated by the same symbols as her cape. Metallic trims decorate the vest and her plating; but most importantly, a diadem adorns her head, which has an iridescent gem at the front, signifying her honor and devotion as the spirit of Ionia.
