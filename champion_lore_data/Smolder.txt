Early Life

As the kingdom of
Camavor
fell as a result of the
Ruination
, most of the imperial dragons allied to the kingdom were corrupted by the Black Mist, and the few that remained stayed as the kingdom crumbled. One dragon that survived the aftermath would later give birth to a hatchling centuries later, named Ignacarious Gigantareno Rex Le Spes Offerentis. After a shortage of food, his mother headed off to further areas to hunt, but in her absence the baby dragon was captured by a group of beastmasters from
Noxus
, taking him to their ship to sell him for a reward. Before they could make it to the capital, his mother found the captors and destroyed their ship, but her child was swept away by the ocean.
The young dragon washed up on a remote island near Noxus, where he tried to hunt for food on his own. During one hunt, he befriended a human boy named Marinos, who gave him the nickname "Smolder" and taught him how to speak. As the two became close friends, Marinos told Smolder stories of older dragons, while keeping his existence a secret fearing of the Noxians that would sell him as a prize once they found out about his existence. Eventually, Marinos grew up to adulthood and started a family of his own, leaving him unable to spend time with Smolder. While spending time on his own, Smolder practiced how to breathe fire like the dragons he idolized, but after many attempts gone wrong, he ended up releasing flames for the first time but unwittingly set the nearby forest on fire in the process.
The wildfire eventually caught the attention of Smolder's mother, whom had been searching for him for decades. With a deafening roar, she reunited with her son before carrying him away from the fire, as he felt the freedom of experiencing the world as a true dragon. She took him to the cliffs of Noxus where she had lived while searching for him, where she would teach him about his ancestry and how to improve his strength. With his future ahead of him, Smolder now wishes to grow up into a powerful dragon so that he would usher in a new age for Camavor.

Smolder's mother is fiercely protective towards him, attacking anyone that tries to harm him. When he was deserted on an island, she spent decades searching for her son never giving up hope that she would find him. Since their reunion, she taught him about the feats of his predecessors and how to hone his abilities, so that he matures into a powerful dragon. While she doesn't speak verbally, Smolder's interpretations of her speech imply that she acts like a doting mother towards him always concerned with his activities.

Marinos

Smolder first encountered Marinos during a hunt, with the two becoming companions. Marinos raised the young dragon throughout his early childhood, giving him the name "Smolder" along with teaching him how to speak and utilize his powers, though he kept his existence a secret from Noxians passing through for fear that they would sell him for monetary value. He told Smolder stories of the imperial dragons from Camavor, inspiring him to be like his predecessors. Eventually, Marinos grew up and was unable to continue raising him, though Smolder still regards Marinos highly and hopes to see his new family.
