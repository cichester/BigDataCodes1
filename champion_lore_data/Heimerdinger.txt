Early Life
[

|
edit source
]

Not much is known about Heimerdinger's early life in
Bandle City
. At some point he would venture out from the
Spirit Realm
and would witness a magical catastrophe that devastated
Runeterra
. Eventually, Heimerdinger helped found the golden city of
Piltover
to serve as a refuge from magical forces, and after being inspired by a scientist one day,
[
5
]
Heimerdinger would pursue this field to become one of the city's most celebrated inventors.
[
6
]
Heimerdinger became a professor, being named the dean of Piltover Academy and mentoring students and inventing unconventional devices to help the people of the city, with his statue adorning the entrance of this prestigious school.
[
1
]
He would also become the head of the Piltover Council, as well as the longest-serving councilor in Piltover's history.
With the immortal lifespan of a
yordle
, Heimerdinger long outlived the vast majority of his contemporaries and would carry vital wisdom about the high and low points of the city's history. Heimerdinger met numerous bright minds, some of which would become Heimerdinger's closest friends, such as
Stanwick Pididly
.
[
7
]
At some point, Heimerdinger worked with an Academy alchemist named
Corin Reveck
, whose intellect was unmatched by any of his peers. However, when Reveck's unethical experiments to save his daughter
Orianna
were brought to light, Reveck lost the respect of his colleagues and was dismissed from Piltover Academy, after which Heimerdinger stopped working with him.
[
8
]
[
9
]
Years after Dr. Reveck's dismissal, Heimerdinger discovered a young scholar from the undercity named
Viktor
, and impressed by his brilliance, enrolled him for a full education and Academy scholarship.
[
6
]
At some point, Heimerdinger also came to favor
Jayce
of House Talis, an ambitious young Academy student who was seemingly destined for greatness, should his mind be put to the greater good of Piltover.

Discovery of Hextech
[
edit
|
edit source
]


During
Jayce's
time as a student, his study was caught in an explosion that revealed a number of unauthorized materials on Academy property, and Heimerdinger sent
Viktor
, whom he had hired as his assistant, to removing anything dangerous from the premises. As Jayce had been arrested by the authorities, Heimerdinger visited him personally in his cell and asked him about his unsanctioned research. When he found out that the boy was working on harnessing magic through science, Heimerdinger warned him of the dangers and advised him not to mention it during his Council hearing — advice that Jayce ultimately ignored. After this public confession, the Ethos demanded Jayce be banished from
Piltover
, but after Jayce's
mother
pleaded on her son's behalf, Heimerdinger suggested expelling him from the Academy instead — a far more lenient sentence which only a slim majority of the Council agreed to.
[
1
]
After the trial, Heimerdinger made plans to destroy Jayce's materials and ordered Viktor to lock up his lab for the night. However, Viktor disobeyed the professor's warnings and helped Jayce to complete his
"hextech"
experiment, and with some help from Councilor
Mel Medarda
, the two aspiring inventors broke into Heimerdinger's lab and got hextech to function without destructive results.
[
10
]
Heimerdinger and his guards arrived too late to thwart Jayce and Viktor, and though he remained against the widespread implementation of hextech, he was eventually overruled by Mel and the other councilors, who could no longer deny the enterprise's potential benefits. Over the next few years, Jayce and Viktor would build the Hexgate, which transformed Piltover a central hub for global shipping lanes, and Heimerdinger was eventually forced to accept that hextech had revolutionized Piltover, but would continue to seek out ways to safeguard it from misuse.

Piltovan Bicentennial

The Celebration
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Over time,
Jayce
became a celebrity across
Piltover
, and to celebrate his pupil's success, Heimerdinger gave up his slot at the bicentennial Progress Day to allow Jayce the honor of speaking to the city's people. In preparation for Jayce's speech, he and
Viktor
tried to pitch their newest
hextech
inventions to Heimerdinger — most notably a hextech gemstone — which was made from fortified hextech crystals and could safely power any hextech device, like the
Atlas gauntlets
and
hexclaw
. Although impressed, Heimerdinger believed Jayce and Viktor's inventions needed at least another decade of development and advised Jayce not to go ahead with the showcase, despite Viktor's protests. Jayce eventually took Heimerdinger's advice during his speech, but this did not prevent hextech from falling into the wrong hands, as a
terrorist
from the undercity would soon steal the gemstone after blowing up several
enforcers
on the Academy Square. After this, Heimerdinger supported a motion by
Councilor Medarda
to elevate Jayce to a seat on the Council so that he could better safeguard the Hexgate and all matters dependent on it.
[

]

Dismissal from the Council
[
edit
|
edit source
]

After Jayce became a councilor, he began acquiring substantial political influence with Mel's guidance, which Heimerdinger was largely oblivious to.
[
11
]
When Heimerdinger later learned that Viktor had been diagnosed with a terminal disease, he went to visit him, but all he could do to comfort him was tell him he lived a life he could be proud of. Viktor, however, was determined to cure his illness and invented a device called the
hexcore
, which had the potential to augment organic matter. When he hit a roadblock testing the device on plants, Viktor and Jayce once again consulted Heimerdinger in hopes he could make the device workable. When he saw the device, Heimerdinger recognized the patterns within it from the apocalyptic power he had witnessed long ago and immediately demanded its destruction. When Jayce and Viktor refused, Heimerdinger vowed to have the hexcore destroyed by invoking his political powers, as he considered the device's very existence a violation of the Ethos.
Heimerdinger called a Council meeting, where he gave a speech about holding each other accountable and trying to heal the divide between Piltover and
Zaun
. However, Jayce interrupted and dismissed his speech as useless platitudes and blamed Heimerdinger's inaction for the current crisis, putting forth a motion to force Heimerdinger into an early retirement. Although it was obvious to Heimerdinger that Jayce's true concern was about his hextech inventions, Jayce's speech still resonated with the other councilors, and after Mel supported Jayce's motion, the rest of the Council followed. Jayce raised his hand last, and with that, the vote was unanimous.

Meeting the Firelights
[

edit source
]


After being forcibly ousted from the Council, Heimerdinger made his way to Zaun and was startled to see the dire, violent conditions his people were living in. Heimerdinger tried offering them assistance, but his efforts were rebuffed and he soon decided to return to Piltover. On his way back, he found and was impressed with a hoverboard by the Bridge of Progress and soon met its owner, a young inventor from the undercity named
Ekko
. Heimerdinger noticed that Ekko's leg had been injured,
[
12
]
so he helped him back to his home in the
Firelights
' base. As the two became friends, Heimerdinger decided to take Ekko under his wing as a new student, and they began discussing their thoughts on Ekko's inventions, particularly his hoverboard.
[

Investigating the Anomaly
[

Corruption in the Firelight Tree
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Heimerdinger decided to remain in
Zaun
for some time, befriending a large number of the refugees around the
Firelights
hideout. Eventually,
Ekko
approached the professor with concerns about some corrupted leaves falling from the Firelight tree. Heimerdinger recognized the patterns in the leaves from the plants used in
Viktor's
hexcore
research, and they left to sneak into his laboratory in Piltover, even though Heimerdinger could have easily just walked in through the entrance. On the Academy grounds, Heimerdinger led Ekko through the building's vents, but they were caught by
Jayce
, who had been sleeping in his lab ever since Viktor was nearly killed in a
terrorist attack
. Since Viktor and his hexcore were now gone from the lab, Heimerdinger consulted Jayce instead on the patterns in the leaves,
[
14
]
and Jayce explained Viktor's theory on "wild runes," in which certain commands would trigger primal, natural reactions within the arcane. Heimerdinger and Ekko theorized that the corruption in the tree was a property of the arcane itself, making it an unintended side effect of the overuse of hextech.
To investigate the source of the problem, Jayce took Ekko and Heimerdinger to the bottom of the Hexgate, which was located in Zaun. As Ekko began to blame Jayce for building the device so close to Zaun's water supply, Heimerdinger noticed a strange pool of corruption on the floor, which soon manifested into a massive spherical Anomaly — the source of the corruption. The Anomaly absorbed Jayce, Ekko, and Heimerdinger into its sphere, hurling them through time, space, and nothingness.
[
15
]

A World Without Hextech
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Heimerdinger landed in a parallel universe where hextech was never invented, and eventually deduced that he and his students had been thrust across dimensions and scattered across time. As Heimerdinger waited for his students to show up, he came to enjoy living in this new world, honing his musical skills and interacting on a regular basis with the undercity folk. Over the next few years, Heimerdinger accomplished many "wonderful things" in his new reality and began to frequent the Last Drop, and after a certain point, Piltover and Zaun began to prosper and lived side-by-side in peace.
After waiting for 1128 days, Heimerdinger noticed that his version of Ekko had finally arrived, inhabiting the body of his alternate self. As they spoke outside the Last Drop, Heimerdinger explained that he had been sent several years before Ekko and that Jayce was unlikely to arrive in this universe, as the Anomaly had reacted differently to him. Ekko, worried about the people he had left behind in the other timeline, was intent on finding a way to get back home, but Heimerdinger had become accustomed to this new reality and urged Ekko to live a happy life there instead, as they had no real way back. Ekko refused to settle down, however, and in the ruins of Jayce's old study, he recovered the broken shards of the hextech crystal that had exploded. After bringing the shards back to Heimerdinger, the professor was initially reluctant to help, but he relented, not wanting to forsake another one of his students. Heimerdinger believed they wouldn't be able to recreate the Anomaly on their own, so Ekko enlisted the help of
Powder
, the
Vander's
daughter who often helped this timeline's version of Ekko with his inventions.
After many trials and calculations, Ekko, Heimerdinger, and Powder succeeded at engineering a stable Anomaly using the shattered fragments, which he managed to contain within a hextech device called the
Z-Drive
. Upon experimenting with the device, they discovered it had the ability to
rewind time
to a limit of four seconds, which Ekko accomplished by inverting Jayce's acceleration rune. After testing the device a few more times, Heimerdinger offered to boost the Anomaly inside Ekko's device so it would be able to send them home, telling Ekko to enjoy his party as he built in the upgrade. When Ekko eventually returned, he was just in time for Heimerdinger to activate a massive, unstable contraption, which would expand the new Anomaly to a size large enough to transport them. However, Heimerdinger didn't intend to send himself back with Ekko and suddenly left the bubble to finish activating the device from the outside, declaring he had "truly lived" before he vanished into thin air, successfully sending his pupil back to his home dimension.

Disappearance and Legacy
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Having disappeared in the parallel universe, Heimerdinger never returned to
Piltover
to resume his position as dean of the Academy. After the end of the martial law period, the clans elected a new Council, but Heimerdinger's seat remained notably empty.
[
16
]
After some time, revisionists on the Council would try to cover up the fact that Heimerdinger ever even served in Piltover's government, with some even claiming not to remember who he was.
[
17
]

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Heimerdinger is a small, light-furred
yordle
. His most prominent feature is his lush blond hair on his head (alternating between curly and straight), blue eyes, pointy ears, as well as his white mustache. He wears a dark blue-grey lab coat with gold accents, dark belt and gloves, and sometimes puts on round metal goggles to protect him during dangerous experimentation. After traveling to the parallel reality where hextech was never invented, Heimerdinger would wear a slightly brighter coat and would carry around a small mechanical banjo on his back, which he could play along with a harmonica attached to a frame next to his mustache.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Heimerdinger is an eccentric scientist and inventor with a drive to nurture curiosity, encourage exploration, oversee experimentation, and inspire innovation and imagination. He is wise, having lived a long life as a
yordle
, but his experiences have made him cautious—he is wary of the potential consequences of new technologies and prefers to test them over the course of years or even decades, taking care to ensure that his inventions can be safely used by the people of his city. Heimerdinger believes no science should ever endanger innocent lives; such that he originally believed the arcane could not and should not be scientifically created, as he has seen its raw destructive potential fall into the wrong hands. Heimerdinger's reluctance to support
hextech
led him to conflict with
Jayce
and
Viktor
, who were both far more ambitious and far less cautious than Heimerdinger ever wished to be.
Heimerdinger is meticulous, detail-oriented, and always precise when it comes to making his inventions practical and workable. As a teacher, he is kind and approachable, always willing to share his knowledge with others and showing an earnest, almost childlike enthusiasm whenever he discusses scientific theory. Heimerdinger cares deeply about the accomplishments of his students, believing his old friend Stanwick Pididly was right to prioritize nurturing a new generation of scholars over his own personal ambitions. Heimerdinger's perception of time, however, is warped by his extraordinarily long lifespan, which sometimes leads him to seem out of touch from basic human needs and struggles. His failure to provide the basic needs and security to his people eventually led the city to reject his leadership, and Heimerdinger was voted out of office by his fellow councilors.
After Heimerdinger was dismissed from the Council, he went to live with
Ekko
and the
Firelights
, who taught him a great deal about the simple joys of living and enjoying each and every moment. Heimerdinger became visibly happier during this time, embracing his old love for constructing odd, quirky inventions to entertain and help the people around him. Heimerdinger also abandoned his serious disposition, donning a silly mask as a disguise and sneaking into the Academy when he did not have to. Having enjoyed listening to music in the opera house as a councilor, Heimerdinger eventually decided to develop his own musical talents by learning to sing and play the banjo. In his scientific work, Heimerdinger remained cautious as always but became far less rigid in this regard, letting himself be driven by his optimism instead of his fear of the unknown or uncontrollable, and by the time he helped Ekko get back home, he had become truly satisfied with the life he had lived.

Abilities
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Professor:
As dean of Piltover Academy, Heimerdinger's expertise makes him one of the greatest teachers the City of Progress has to offer, known for tutoring many of Piltover's most innovative minds over its two hundred year history. Among his students are a number of genius inventors, including
Jayce
,
Viktor
, and
Ekko
. Having been inspired by his friend
Stanwick
, Heimerdinger believes that the greatest achievement for a teacher is to be surpassed by his own students, and he always makes certain to seek out young and brilliant minds that he can cultivate under his instruction.
Inventor
:
Heimerdinger is among the most revered minds in all of Piltover, with his expertise being consulted and valued by many of his colleagues and former students. Heimerdinger is the inventor of a vast assortment of mechanical contraptions, one of which is the
H-28G Evolution Turret
, which can produce bubbles from its nozzle.
[
14
]
Other devices designed and engineered by Heimerdinger include a clockwork
poro
, a flying hoverbike, and the
D.I.N.G.R.
(a mechanical arm to help him lift heavy crates).
[
18
]
Despite viewing the practice as dangerous, Heimerdinger ha a keen understanding of
hextech
and was able to help Ekko build and perfect his
Z-Drive
, which he was able to upgrade to create a massive Anomaly which could be used as an interdimensional portal.
[
3
]
Yordle
Physiology:
Heimerdinger is a yordle, a magical being from the
Spirit Realm
and possesses several abilities natural of his species.
Immortality:
Being spiritual beings, yordles don't age the same way as normal humans, and they can't normally die.
Yordle Magic:
Just like any yordle, Heimerdinger is capable of performing yordle magic, which he utilizes in tandem with his skills as an inventor.
Musician:
At some point after being sent to the alternate world without hextech, Heimerdinger began to hone his musical skills, which allowed him to play banjo and harmonica and sing in public to entertain crowds in Zaun.

Relations
[

]

Jayce Talis
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Heimerdinger met Jayce when he was a young student at the Academy, and came to favor him, with Jayce reminding Heimerdinger of himself when he was younger. Jayce in turn held Heimerdinger in high regard and came to view him as a mentor. However, Heimerdinger's more cautious approach to science often clashed with Jayce's ambition to change the world, and he often warned Jayce that magic, which the young inventor was hoping to master through
hextech
, could be too dangerous an enterprise. For the most part, Jayce heeded Heimerdinger's advice and wisdom, such as when he withheld hextech inventions from being made public at the bicentennial Progress Day because Heimerdinger said it needed more safeguards. But Jayce also believed that Heimerdinger could be out of touch and stifling, like when he tried to destroy the hexcore even though
Viktor's
life depended on the project's success. Ultimately, Jayce chose his partner over his mentor, and though he did so regrettably, Jayce was willing to convince the Piltover Council to vote Heimerdinger out under the explanation that he was incapable of resolving the crisis with the undercity.
[
6
]
Despite this development, and the fact that Heimerdinger had left
Piltover
to stay with the
Firelights
in
Zaun
, the two inventors remained on good terms, with Jayce feeling guilty for betraying his mentor and Heimerdinger regretting his decision to forsake his former students when they needed him.
[
8
]
[
3
]
When Jayce caught Heimerdinger and
Ekko
breaking into his laboratory, he welcomed them inside and made them tea as they discussed science. The three of them would then be separated again while investigating the Anomaly, and realizing the Anomaly was behaving differently around Jayce, Heimerdinger deduced that had been sent to a different alternate reality. Though they would not encounter each other again, Heimerdinger seemed to remember Jayce fondly and regretted not having any way to reach him.

Ekko
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Heimerdinger found an injured Ekko and his hoverboard underneath the Bridge of Progress, and was impressed by his hoverboard's design. Ekko was surprised to find a Piltover councilor on Zaun's side of the river, but Heimerdinger revealed that he was just a normal citizen. Both Ekko and Heimerdinger were trying to help the residents of their opposite city but were rebuffed for it, and with Ekko injured, Heimerdinger helped get him home to the
Firelights
' hideout. When they arrived, Heimerdinger marveled at how much the Firelights accomplished at a short amount of time; to which Ekko replied that having their lives on the line was a great motivator. Although Heimerdinger questioned why the Firelights use hoverboards for transportation when more efficient and safer options exist, Ekko replied that it is essential for people to get what they need to live; in addition to what they need to survive.
Having no reason to go back to Piltover, Heimerdinger took Ekko under his wing as his mentor, instructing him in the realm of science and constructing a number of
devices
to entertain the other Firelights. When Ekko became worried that the Firelight tree was dying, he turned to Heimerdinger for advice, and the professor snuck him into
Jayce
and
Viktor's
laboratory, where they began their investigation of the Anomaly. After being sent to an alternate timeline, Heimerdinger arrived far earlier than Ekko did and waited several years for him before eventually seeking a means so that they might return home. While Heimerdinger was helping him to invent the
Z-Drive
, Heimerdinger offered to help Ekko to upgrade the device so it would be able to send them home, telling him to go enjoy the dance with
Powder
.
Heimerdinger was shown to take Ekko's advice to heart in the alternate universe, embracing his musical talents and engaging with the people of the undercity. Ekko tried to stop Heimerdinger from sacrificing himself, but was unable to, and the professor vanished in front of him after declaring that because of Ekko, he had "truly lived."

Piltover
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Heimerdinger was one of the most respected and celebrated inventors in all of Piltover, with statues of him being built outside the entrance to Piltover Academy (among others, like
Stanwick Pididly
). Until the bicentennial, he would always be given the honor of giving the keynote speech during the city's Progress Day ceremonies. Heimerdinger served as dean of the Academy for many years and would often seek out gifted minds that he could cultivate, and would always try to use his inventions to help the people of his city. Heimerdinger's nature as a
yordle
meant he experienced time differently from humans, and while this meant he carried vital wisdom over his centuries in Piltover, it also blinded him to the quickly changing nature of human lives, as well as the conditions his people were suffering under.
As the city's founder, Heimerdinger was the longest-serving member of the Piltover Council, but eventually lost this position when
Jayce
and the others expelled him by unanimous vote for failing to control the
undercity
. After this, Heimerdinger withdrew from Piltover and was seemingly not aware of or invited to the memorial for the fallen councilors after
Jinx's
attack. Heimerdinger's seat was made empty after his removal and remained so after the new Piltover Council was instated, possibly out of respect for the city's founder. Recently, however, some revisionists are trying to cover up the fact that Heimerdinger ever served there, with some of the current councilors even claiming not to remember him.
[
17
]

Stanwick Pididly
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Heimerdinger considered Stanwick Pididly to be a dear friend. According to Heimerdinger, everything Stanwick built either exploded, melted, or toppled over. Yet Stanwick became revered as a remarkable teacher, as he set his personal ambitions aside and focused on something far more important—
Piltover
's future. Stanwick realized nothing he could accomplish could compare to the contributions of his students, and for his sacrifice, Piltover had Stanwick Pididly memorialized in the form of a statue. Heimerdinger remembered Stanwick fondly and would sometimes visit his statue to light a candle for his old friend.
[

]

Singed
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Heimerdinger and Singed, who was then known as Dr. Reveck, used to be colleagues at Piltover Academy and as a result, it can be assumed they were once close. However, as Heimerdinger could not bring himself to accept Singed's increasingly depraved experiments to cure his daughter
Orianna
, and as a result Singed was dismissed from the Academy with no mention of his crime. Currently, the two scientists do not associate themselves with each other, and it's not clear as to whether Heimerdinger even knows that Singed is still alive.
[
8
]
[
9
]

Viktor
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Heimerdinger first discovered an aspiring young Viktor in his "steel oasis" overlooking the Sump waters, and being impressed by his brilliant mind, enrolled him in
Piltover
Academy for a full education to cultivate his genius. Heimerdinger would later hire Viktor as his assistant, and after an accident destroyed
Jayce's
laboratory, Heimerdinger trusted Viktor to remove any hazardous materials from the site. After Jayce's speech at the trial, however, Viktor would be inspired to help Jayce complete his
hextech
research, as his ambition was to change the world, not to remain Heimerdinger's assistant. Viktor disobeyed Heimerdinger's instructions and joined forces with Jayce, breaking into his lab to retrieve the materials and finish the experiment. When Heimerdinger arrived too late to stop them, Viktor ignored Heimerdinger's pleas that Piltover's future would not be decided by hextech. Despite his reservations, however, Heimerdinger continued to view Viktor favorably as one of his pupils, providing counsel and scientific expertise whenever Jayce and Viktor asked.
As the years passed, Viktor attempted to hasten the progress of his scientific achievements, only to be rebuffed by Heimerdinger, who believed that progress could be dangerous if enacted too quickly. Heimerdinger was seemingly unaware of Viktor's deteriorating health and assured him that a decade would pass in the "blink of an eye," remaining more concerned with the city's safety than Viktor's desire to change the world. When Viktor learned he was dying, Heimerdinger attempted to comfort him by expressing pride in his accomplishments, but Viktor described his work as "figments" compared to everything Heimerdinger had achieved. When Viktor attempted to save his own life by inventing the
hexcore
, Heimerdinger opposed the device's use and demanded its destruction, and claimed it had "changed" Viktor without his knowledge. Viktor would come to view the professor as dogmatic and rigid as a result of his outburst, and he would reject his advice, pursuing his hexcore research with the help of
Singed
instead.
Later on, Heimerdinger attempted to consult Viktor's hexcore research when investigating the corruption in the
Firelights
tree. However, Viktor had already left Piltover, and though Heimerdinger expressed concern over Viktor's transformation, he was unable to do anything to stop him.

Mel Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Mel was Heimerdinger's colleague on the Piltover Council, and though she respected him as the city's founder, she worked behind the scenes to undermine his attempts to safeguard and control the development of
hextech
, as unlike Heimerdinger, she believed the possible benefits of the enterprise far outweighed the risks. Mel first assisted in hextech's invention by distracting the Academy guards, and after Heimerdinger arrived to late to prevent the experiment's success, Mel was able to convince the Council to support its widespread development against Heimerdinger's wishes. Years later, after hextech had catapulted
Jayce
to stardom, Mel and Heimerdinger once again came into conflict when the professor persuaded Jayce not to go ahead with his hextech gemstone showcase, which disappointed Mel as she had been hoping to impress a number of investors at the ceremony. Believing Heimerdinger was too focused on the past, Mel put forward a motion to elevate Jayce as a councilor on their body and later helped him expand his political influence, to allow Jayce a means to move forward with his enterprise without being hindered by Heimerdinger. When Jayce eventually put forth a motion to have Heimerdinger removed, his speech aligned with Mel's earlier doubts about the professor, and after Jayce gave her a look, she was the first to support the motion. The other councilors followed her lead, and Heimerdinger was voted off the Council.

Powder
[
edit
|
edit source
]

While Heimerdinger never met
Jinx
in his original timeline (nor was he present at the Council meeting where they learned who she was), he became good friends with Powder and her friends in the parallel universe, as he would frequently visit the Last Drop to check in on Ekko. In Powder's workshop, Heimerdinger and Powder both helped Ekko to invent his
Z-Drive
after much trial and error, after which Heimerdinger upgraded the device on his own to allow Ekko and Powder time to spend together at their party. Heimerdinger felt guilty about using Powder's workshop without her permission, but believed it couldn't be helped as it was
Ekko's
only way back home.
