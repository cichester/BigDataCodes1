Stumbling into
The Glade
[

edit source
]

Lulu, always a deeply empathetic and caring Yordle, once came across an injured bird and instinctively rushed to help. But as she reached for it, the bird transformed into a mischievous
faerie
. Laughing, it flew away, taking Lulu's staff with it, and she eagerly gave chase. As she pursued the faerie, the world around her began to shift and warp. Unbeknownst to Lulu, she had crossed into the spirit realm.
The faerie, who introduced himself as
Pix
, eventually stopped and, with a flick of his fingers, transformed Lulu’s simple walking stick into a magical staff. He led her to a place of ancient, pure primordial magic, where Lulu’s own powers amplified. He led her to
the Glade
.

Lulu in
the Glade
.

Bandle City
, Lulu's home, was a strange and magical place that defied logic, where time was unstable, and the natural laws of the material world did not fully apply. Yet the Glade was an even stranger place - it had existed long before the Yordles came into the world, and perhaps it was from the Glade that Bandle City itself arose.
Here, her imagination could manifest into reality, and she reveled in the freedom of creation. Lulu did not know whether Pix had brought her here because of a similarity of souls, or whether the Glade itself had called her, but she fell in love with this place instantly. She was so lost in the magic and wonder that she eventually forgot about existence of everything else. And time lost its meaning in The Glade - what seemed like mere days to Lulu could have been centuries or even millennia.

Playing pranks on
Runeterra
[

edit source

Lulu travels across Runeterra using her magic freely, as evidenced by HUGIFIED squirrel.

Yet one day, as if awakening from a long sleep, Lulu found herself back in the material realm, unsure of how long she had been gone. To her surprise and delight, she found that some of her newfound power had come with her, allowing her to make small things large, change colours to those more pleasing her, and make creatures spontaneously fall asleep. To Pix's infinite amusement, she turned the most powerful beasts into tiny, confused frogs or squirrels with a single swing of her staff.
While she missed The Glade, Lulu set off on a journey across
Runeterra
, always searching for the elusive way back. Pix, however, claimed to have forgotten the way, but perhaps he did not wish to return yet. Together, they traveled from place to place, pulling playful pranks wherever they went. In lands of
Demacia
, known for their resistance to magic, she led a group of children away from their dull history lessons and transformed them into toadstools, to the horror of their parents and the local militia. The children eventually returned unharmed, but their wild stories were dismissed as fantasies.
In cold territories of
Freljord
, she found herself in the middle of a battle between rival tribes and decided to turn their weapons into flowers for her own amusement, creating chaos and confusion. More recently, Lulu has been seen wandering Ionia, playing among the glowing everblooms of
Qaelin
, and pranking the overly serious acolytes of the
Shadow Order
, who she thinks need to lighten up.
Though Lulu longs to return to the Glade and often misses it, she finds joy in the present, where each day offers new adventures and excitement. Besides, she has come to understand that the Glade is always with her, carried in her heart wherever she goes.

Meeting Tristana

Lulu and Tristana during their journey.

During one of her adventures, Lulu traveled with
Tristana
after visiting
Poppy
. As they stepped through a Yordle gateway, Lulu misplaced her Whispering Key, an ancient and powerful artifact she affectionately referred to as her "Doodad." Ignoring Tristana’s growing concern about a nearby
Noxian
camp, Lulu eagerly used her magic to track it down. Much to Tristana's dismay, the playful artifact began to elude them, shifting into various forms whenever Lulu tried to catch a glimpse of it.
Before long,
Draven
and
Tamara
led a band of Noxian forces in a sudden attack on the two Yordles. However, the land itself rose to aid them, as nature spirits joined the battle. While Tristana bravely held off the Noxians, Lulu remained preoccupied with chasing her ever-elusive Doodad, laughing as it transformed into anything but its true form.
Finally, with the help of the spirits, the Yordles emerged victorious as Draven and the remaining Noxians were chased off by a massive enchanted rabbit. Tristana gave a nod of thanks to the creature, while Lulu expressed her gratitude to the spirits and the land itself. With the battle behind them, the two friends continued on their way, ready for whatever the next adventure would bring.

Don't Mess With Yordles
[

Lulu wants to help in this mission.

One day, when
Teemo
was captured in
Bilgewater
by
Graves
, his yordle friends in Bandle City decided to rescue him. Tristana, Teemo's closest friend, insisted on going alone, but Lulu and
Corki
wanted to help too. Tristana convinced them to go on diversionary missions: she sent Corki after a made-up threat in
Piltover
and told Lulu to keep an eye on a rock by the entrance to Bandle City.
After the others left, Lulu became impatient and pouted, accidentally enlarging Pix's head. Meanwhile, Corki realized he had been tricked and returned to Bandle City, where he invited Lulu to cause some ruckus. By the time they regrouped, Tristana had also been captured. Corki attempted to fly his plane to rescue them, but crashed, landing in a cage.
Lulu, now
larger
than usual and still guarding the rock, approached them, complaining to Tristana that the rock was doing nothing. But when she touched the runic iron cage, she shrank back to her normal size, dropping the rock on Graves' foot and causing him to shoot a rope and accidentally free the other yordles.
In a last-ditch attempt to stop them, Graves grabbed Corki and threatened Tristana, but Lulu playfully and quickly
turned
Graves into a small
gromp
. forcing
Twisted Fate
, who knew how this would end, to take his enchanted friend with him. With the danger over, Tristana thanked her friends for their support, and the yordles returned to Bandle City as Teemo showed everyone his new pet: a soul-devouring sea worm named Fluffy.

Appearance
[

edit source
]

Lulu is a Yordle with lilac-colored skin, and olive-green eyes that have brighter tones closer to the iris. She has straight, long dark purple hair with some lash-grazing pieces in the front.
She wears a vermillion-colored pointy hat and robes with accents of gold. Her shoes are brown with an elf-styled toe tip.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Lulu had always been a caring and deeply empathetic Yordle, living in her whimsical dreams as if they were as real as the world around her. Her visit to the Glade, a realm of boundless primordial magic, only amplified these traits, transforming her perception of reality forever.
Nowadays, Lulu is an imaginative and carefree Yordle who lives in a constant state of wonder and playfulness, often blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. Her deep connection to the fae spirit Pix and her time spent in the Glade have made her both powerful and unpredictable. Lulu’s whimsical nature means she often acts without thinking of the consequences. Whether she’s turning enemies into harmless creatures or meddling in conflicts for her own amusement, Lulu sees it all as a fun game.
Despite the chaos she causes, Lulu is kind-hearted and means no harm. Still, Lulu’s complete disregard for logic or caution means that her spells can create as much confusion as wonder, tipping the balance between delight and disaster for those around her.
Lulu is fiercely loyal to her friends, even if her antics often leave them bewildered. Beneath her playful exterior, however, lies a hidden vulnerability—despite her cheerful demeanor, Lulu fears deep down that other Yordles don’t truly understand or accept her, and that they may even despise her. It's possible, that this underlying fear of rejection, along with a profound loneliness, lingers beneath her whimsical surface, driving her to seek companionship through her playful escapades.
