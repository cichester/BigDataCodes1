Early life

Gwen was originally crafted as a doll by a seamstress named
Isolde
, embodying her desire for adventure and royalty. Isolde loved her doll very much and would spend hours sewing and playing with her. Eventually, Isolde would be courted by
Viego
, the king of Camavor, and would no longer have time to play with her cherished doll. At first, Gwen could sense that Viego made her creator happy, but their love would sour and become painful. Isolde would fall ill due to an assassin's blade and eventually pass. Viego took Isolde's corpse to the Blessed Isles in hopes of reviving her, but unleashed ruination instead. Without their king, the nation of Camavor would crumble and Gwen would be forgotten for centuries.

Gwen would eventually find herself on the Shadow Isles when Viego was awakened by
Gangplank
and
Thresh
. Viego would be defeated by
Ahri
,
Braum
,
Illaoi
,
Miss Fortune
,
Pyke
, and
Yasuo
and imprisoned within an amulet. The Ruined King would somehow escape the amulet and resume his search for his queen. The fragments of Isolde's soul scattered across Runeterra and imbued themselves into various fetters, one of them being Gwen. Gwen would be brought to life by the fragment of Isolde's soul and found herself with an oversized pair of scissors, needles, and thread. She would soon be attacked by a swarm of wraiths and remembered the pain associated with Viego, she quickly dispatched the wraiths and knew that they were tied with him. Fascinated by the wonders of life, Gwen would set out to explore the world and stop the pain caused by Viego and the Black Mist.

The Stranger Who Sews

Gwen
was watching children play from afar, while she was protected from the Black Mist. The Black Mist threatens to attack the children's house so Gwen unhesitatingly undoes her
Hallowed Mist
and begins to purge the specters of the Black Mist to protect the children.
Right after the children's mother appears and thanks her, Gwen observes the mother's hands and sees several calluses and wounds. The mother was a seamstress and made dolls for her children to play with, so Gwen felt the affection that
Isolde
had when creating and sewing her.
Gwen then understands that her creator's true magic was love.

Gwen soon found herself at the Sentinels of Light's headquarters where she would meet
Lucian
,
Senna
and a Rookie. She aided them in repelling a swarm of wraiths and joined them in stopping Viego's global harrowing. She would travel with the Sentinels across Runeterra, chasing after the other fetters and repelling Viego's attacks. Along the way, the Sentinels would recruit more fighters into their ranks and Gwen would give haircuts and tailor new uniforms for
Diana
,
Graves
,
Irelia
,
Olaf
,
Pyke
,
Rengar
,
Riven
, and
Vayne
. When Viego obtained most of the fetters, the Sentinels launched one last assault against him on the Shadow Isles. Gwen attempted to bind him within the Hallowed Mist, but Viego quickly dispatched her with a stroke of his blade. He took her, Senna and the Maiden of the Mist to Camavor to resurrect Isolde. Viego tore the fragment of Isolde's soul within Gwen, killing her and the other fetters, and revived his queen.  Isolde was horrified at what Viego had done and rejected him. She prompted
Akshan
to kill her with his Absolver and revived Gwen, Senna and the Maiden. Gwen then was able to seal him within the Hallowed Mist and the threat of the Ruined King was over. Gwen reckoned with Senna about Isolde being truly gone now, but was ready to live her life to the fullest.
After some time,
Gwen
continued to clear the black mist on the
Shadow Isles
. As she made her way through the
Black Mist
, she found an opulent mansion in the shadowy woods. As she investigated, Gwen discovered that it was home to the Midnight Revel, a grand ball hosted by friendly spirits, whom invited her in as their guest of honor. She attended the party, protecting it from the Black Mist and dancing the night away.

]

Gwen is a doll given life by the Hallowed Mist and a fragment of Isolde's soul, representing her kindness, love and joy, granting her self awareness and a independent personality.
Having being created as an idealized character by Isolde as a little girl, Gwen has the personality of a idealized princess of fairy tales, highly polite and graceful. She's kind, friendly, and excitable, eager to see the world,  curious and in love of everything in it. Having been alive for only a short time, she is terrified of dying.
Although generally friendly and genuine in her niceness, Gwen is not unaware of the darkness of the world. She dutifully fights the evils of the Black Mist to protect the world she was born in, and she has nothing but contempt for the
Shadow Isles
's most  malevolent members, such as
Thresh
and
Viego
.

Abilities
[

Magically Altered Physiology:
Gwen's body is magically altered and extremely unique due to the circumstances of her birth. Though she was initially a doll created by
Isolde
, she has been fully granted life by her creator thanks to the magic of the mystical
Hallowed Mist
and is, by all means, considered a human to some extent.
Hallowed Mist Manipulation:
Having been granted life and blessed by the hallowed opposite of the accursed Black Mist, Gwen is capable of manipulating this mist for many capabilities. The Hallowed Mist's main function is to protect both herself and others within her cloud of mist, practically rendering them both hidden and immune from outside dangers. Those under the effect of her Hallowed Mist tend to feel a sense of comfort and calmness to them when it envelops them. As the antithesis of the Black Mist, Gwen has shown that she can utilize the Hallowed Mist to banish and ward off any
undead
affected by the mist, being strong enough to imprison the
Ruined King
himself.
Hallowed Mist Constructs:
Gwen can manipulate the Hallowed Mist into many different shapes, most commonly in the form of common sewing materials and tools. With these constructs, Gwen can use them to attack enemies, most notably any undead.
Enchantment:
Gwen can use the Hallowed Mist to enchant and strengthen other objects to be more capable of fighting off the Black Mist. She can use this in the creation of new objects, such as the many outfits she fashioned for the
Sentinels of Light
which she sewed with threads made from the mist itself, or she can enchant common items such as she did with her signature
scissors
.
Scissor Proficiency:
Gwen typically uses a giant, enchanted pair of scissors in combat which she has enchanted with the Hallowed Mist. Gwen wields these scissors with ease, capable of quickly cutting up entire groups of enemies with speed. Along with that, Gwen has shown that she's able to manipulate the scissors with her mind, telekinetically moving it and allowing it to cut enemies without needing to touch it.
Sewing Mastery:
Being a doll created by Isolde, who already had a talent in sewing, Gwen is an supernaturally talented seamstress. Other than the fact that her manipulation of the Hallowed Mist directly reflects her talent as a seamstress, Gwen can create entire, intricate outfits almost instantly when provided enough fabric and materials, just as she did with the Sentinels of Light.
