Early Life
[

edit source
]

Singed was once a revered
Piltovan
scholar named
Dr. Corin Reveck
, an unrivaled genius and alchemist at Piltover Academy. Singed was a respected colleague of
Professor Cecil B. Heimerdinger
, and he had a daughter named
Orianna
whom he loved very dearly. However, Orianna would pass away due to unknown causes, and he turned to increasingly unethical and inhumane methods in his attempts to save her life. These experiments ultimately cost him the respect of
Piltover's
scientific community, including Heimerdinger, and he was eventually dismissed from the Academy with no mention of his crime.
[

]
As a direct result of this, Singed would leave both Piltover and Heimerdinger, moving to a new laboratory in
Zaun
.

The Waverider Mutation
[

edit source
]


Singed would continue his research, now seeking a way to bring his daughter back from death. He built his new lab in a hidden cave, where he kept his
Orianna's
body preserved within a
chemtech
pod in a secret room, where he would sometimes read her bedtime stories.
[

]
At a certain point, Singed cultivated a
waverider
specimen named Rio, who had a rare mutation that was beneficial for his research.
One day while he was working with Rio, Singed met a young boy named
Viktor
, who had stumbled across his laboratory by the Sump waters. Impressed by a mechanical toy boat that Viktor had built, Singed introduced Viktor to Rio, and explained that he was looking for a way to extend her life. Viktor initially offered to help Singed to save the creature. However, Singed's method in keeping Rio alive involved a series of implants that left her in a constant state of pain, which drove the boy away, leaving Singed alone once again in his pursuits.

The Invention of Shimmer
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Several years after
Vander
became the de-facto leader of the undercity, Singed was hired by a local Zaunite gangster named
Silco
, who was attempting to start a violent rebellion against Piltover. Silco was interested in raising an army of physically-augmented soldiers to start his rebellion, and to this end, Singed invented an addictive superhuman drug called
shimmer
. While initially testing shimmer on rats,
[
5
]
the doctor would soon move on to human experimentation by testing it on Silco's least favorite henchman at the time,
Deckard
.
[
6
]
The experiment was a success, and the serum was capable of transforming Deckard into a hulking, monstrous mutant for a limited period of time. However, during Silco's battle against Vander, the entire factory would be destroyed by Vander's daughter,
Powder
, who was attempting to save him. Singed was caught in the explosion
[
7
]
and suffered severe burns on the right and lower halves of his face, leaving him physically-scarred and forcing him to wear bandages to cover the ruined parts of his skin.
At some point after the battle, Singed collected the bodies of several people who had perished in Silco's factory for his research, including the bodies of Vander and Deckard, who were both heavily-infused with shimmer. The doctor kept Deckard's head in a jar
[
8
]
, and kept Vander's body hanging from chains on his laboratory's ceiling for later use.
[

Piltovan Bicentennial
[
edit
|
edit source
]

In the following years,
Silco
was able to solidify control over the undercity and its
chembarons
, fueling his empire with Singed's
shimmer
concoction, which had been refined and perfected over time as a commodified, illegal drug.
[
10
]
Singed continued to work for Silco during this time, and would sometimes be called upon for his scientific expertise.
[
11
]
One day, Singed received a visit from his former pupil,
Viktor
, who had become an inventor in
Piltover
and was turning to increasingly desperate measures for his scientific experiments. Viktor wanted to consult the doctor on a quandary regarding his latest
hextech
invention, the
hexcore
, which he hoped might hold the key to augmenting human physiology. Singed took an interest in Viktor's hexcore and agreed to help him, giving him a vial of shimmer that would help Viktor to test the device's capabilities on himself and cure his terminal illness.
[
2
]
Later, when
Jinx
was mortally wounded in her battle with
Ekko
, Silco took her to Singed to perform a life-saving surgery. Using a highly experimental shimmer procedure, he was able to save her life and enhance her physical abilities to superhuman levels. However, the procedure also exacerbated her mental instability and hallucinations, permanently changing her eye color to pink. Singed sedated Silco so he would not interfere with the procedure, and when he regained consciousness, Jinx was gone. Silco threatened the doctor and demanded to know what he'd done. Singed simply replied that he had saved her life.

Engineering the Nightmare
[
edit
|
edit source
]

After
Silco's
death, Singed went to examine the body of
Vander
,
[
9
]
which he had transformed into a savage chimeric beast known as
Warwick
through a series of long and painful experiments. Singed had been able to revive Vander using a combination of
shimmer
,
chemtech
implants,
[
13
]
and
murk wolf
DNA,
[
14
]
[
15
]
which triggered a gruesome and unnatural mutation within the specimen. Vander's extraordinary will to live made him an invaluable subject, and his blood developed regenerative properties as a result of his mutation, at the cost of his mind. Singed attempted to recover Vander's mind, but was unable to find the right catalyst. Still, he considered this experiment to be a remarkable success, believing Warwick's blood held the final key toward his ultimate goal of finding a cure to death.
[
1
]
With Silco dead and the other
chembarons
gone, Singed was lacking a sponsor for his research and began to roam the streets of the undercity. He came upon
Sevika's
rally, where he observed as she and
Isha
attempted to unite the
Firelights
, Jinxers, and chemgoons whose bosses had been eliminated. The rally was quickly busted by a squad of
Enforcers
and
Noxian
soldiers led by
Rictus
, the right-hand man of General
Ambessa Medarda
. Most of the chemgoons, Jinxers, and Firelights were captured by the authorities.
[
16
]
Though he could have attempted to escape, Singed instead allowed himself to be captured, cutting his palm with a scalpel. The blood dripping from Singed's hand awakened his beast, who broke free from Singed's laboratory and followed Singed's scent, which led directly to Stillwater Hold. After
Jinx
eventually broke Isha and the other prisoners free, Singed locked his cell back up to protect himself from Warwick's rampage,
[
16
]
and he watched with interest as Vander's mind flickered with the recognition of his daughter. The two of them eventually got away, and Singed was the only prisoner left on the entire floor.

Service to Ambessa Medarda
[
edit

edit source
]


Following the trail of blood,
Caitlyn Kiramman
quickly deduced Singed as the culprit responsible for Warwick's attack on Stillwater, and she interrogated him, demanding to know his connection to Jinx. Singed did not crack under the pressure, reacting coldly and indifferently to the young commander's threats. After he'd been returned to his cell, Singed was approached by Ambessa, who was interested in recruiting him so she might use his chemtech weapons and mutant abominations. Singed, who was interested in a new sponsor for his research, accepted Ambessa's proposal and began to engineer a means to figure out Warwick's location.
As Singed was working in his laboratory, Caitlyn ran an investigation into Singed's past, discovering his true identity as Dr. Reveck, a disgraced Piltovan alchemist whose crimes were too unspeakable to be kept on record. Under threat of being killed, Singed showed Caitlyn and Ambessa to the secret room where he kept his daughter, and he explained that his life's work was to find a cure for death so she might live again.
[
1
]
Ambessa took an interest in Singed's "cure to death", and her army made plans to recapture Warwick so they could use him as both a weapon and a specimen to complete Singed's research.
[
17
]

The Transfusion
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Using a small chemtech device of his own construction, Singed was able to track Warwick to a large underground
commune
that was ruled by a Herald with healing powers, whom Singed quickly deduced was actually
Viktor
, who had been transformed by the
hexcore's
power. Though Ambessa had brought an entire army, Singed offered to negotiate on her behalf, and found Viktor, who was attempting to heal Warwick's mind. The doctor explained that the hexcore's power was limited and that in order for Viktor to survive, he would have to use a transfusion of Warwick's blood, which contained regenerative properties. A combination of apex hextech with apex shimmer would theoretically complete both Viktor's transformation and Singed's long-sought "cure to death"; however, Viktor refused Singed's offer, as it would destroy any chance of rescuing Vander's humanity from within the beast.
As the negotiations had failed, Singed reported back to Ambessa and formed a new plan, where he would inject Warwick with a
serum
that would prevent Viktor from restoring Vander's sanity. Singed was accompanied by Caitlyn, who would suddenly betray and incapacitate him, preventing him from injecting Warwick with the serum. However,
Jayce's
sudden attack on Viktor caused Warwick to become enraged anyway, and Singed would watch the battle unfold from the burning wreckage of Viktor's commune.
[

]
After the battle, Singed treated the wounded. While Singed was unable to save Rictus, he was able to sustain Viktor by suspending his body in a large purple sphere sustained by shimmer and chemtech tubes, which he attached to Warwick's unconscious body. When Viktor regained consciousness, he thanked Singed for saving his life, speaking through the collapsed bodies of his followers. Singed observed as Viktor transformed the body of
Huck
into a metal puppet, and he later assisted in the full transformation of Viktor and his followers by completing the aforementioned transfusion of Warwick's blood using the serum, which erased Vander's memories.
[
17
]
For Ambessa's invasion of Piltover, Singed would provide her army with massive amounts of shimmer, which would physically-enhance a large number of her soldiers.
[

Curing Death
[
edit
|
edit source
]

At some point after the battle, after
Ambessa
and
Viktor
were both gone, Singed finally completed his cure to death, and after administering this cure,
Orianna
awoke in a new
hextech
body. Singed presented his daughter with a number of gifts, including a music box, a flower with a ribbon, and a wooden horse. Orianna looked at none of these items, instead staring blankly at her own reflection in the mirror.
[
18
]

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Singed was a tall but extremely thin and pale-skinned, elderly man with balding chestnut hair, brown eyes, and an underbite with crooked teeth. The doctor always wore the same simple green and burgundy clothes, with a plain brown lab coat that hung below his waist. The fire that destroyed Silco's factory burned off all Singed's hair and left many scars over his entire body, especially the right and lower halves of his face, with his lips seared and peeling away and his right eye glowing a sickly green color. After this, Singed started wearing bandages on his face, arms, and torso to cover up the burns and missing skin, as well as a wide burgundy scarf to cover his ruined mouth and nose like a tall collar above his old lab coat. He would also wear a matching metal pauldron over his left shoulder, as well as belts to carry many vials of green chemical liquids.
The doctor often carried a scalpel that could be used as a weapon, and would sometimes bring with him a large glass canister over his shoulder to be used for his experiments. He also carried with him a large circular locket with his
Orianna's
portrait, which he would sometimes hold open in his palm.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Singed has grown to have little faith in humanity, believing ethics to be nothing more than a roadblock to true progress. This cynical mindset was likely developed following the death of his daughter
Orianna
and the ostracization he received from
Piltover's
scientific community during his efforts to save her. Singed is very secretive when dealing with others, never divulging his name even to those whom he's worked with closely, including
Silco
, and as a result most simply refer to him as "doctor". Still, Singed is proven to make good on his promises, serving both Silco and
Ambessa
until their respective deaths.
Despite his callous demeanor, Singed was not always heartless, as he used to have genuinely good intentions since he wanted his experiments to save lives. He felt a sincere kinship with
Viktor
due to their similar pasts from being sickly and frail, and helped him try to find a way to cure his illness even though the two of them had not seen each other in years. He was also shown to love and mourn Orianna, and gave Silco a sedative before operating on
Jinx
so he wouldn't have to watch his own daughter suffer.
While there are many geniuses within Piltover and
Zaun
, the biggest trait that separates Singed from the rest is his patience. He has lived an extraordinarily long life as a result of his chemically-enhanced biology, and with his age he has learned to act deliberately and with focus, and very rarely making mistakes where others would. This allows Singed to treat every unexpected outcome as less of a despairing defeat and more an experiment in itself, improving on successes while learning from failures, but always making steady progress towards the ultimate goal of his research.

Abilities
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Chemically Enhanced Physiology:
Singed has lived an exceptionally-long life, having chemically-altered his own biology in order to continue his research without loss of energy or interruptions.
Doctor:
Singed is an infamous doctor in
Zaun
whose medical procedures are responsible for saving the lives of many, including
Jinx
,
Viktor
, and
Orianna
. He is a skilled surgeon and is able to deploy sedatives and medicines by injection as necessary, which can make both patients and enemies alike lose consciousness. The doctor's treatments are painful and highly-experimental, but often yield results, with a few exceptions. Singed's life's work was to find a cure for death; a goal he would eventually achieve through many decades of painstaking research.
Alchemist:
Singed was once one of the most respected alchemists in all of Piltover and is the inventor of numerous potions and chemical concoctions, most of which are engineered toward the goal of human transmutation or the augmentation of human life. Some of the mutant abominations credited to his ability are
Rio
and
Warwick
. While he specializes in chemtech, Singed is also proven to have a grasp of
hextech
, having developed a keen understanding of Viktor's hexcore by simply looking through his notes. Singed is able to combine hextech and chemtech to unprecedented results.
Shimmer
:
Singed's most infamous invention, it is a drug-like serum known for enhancing human biology, including physical strength and healing. Shimmer is a potent substance but is highly-addictive, and people who take it frequently suffer withdrawals from its use. Singed generally uses its effects to empower
others
, or to enable the transformations of his scientific subjects.
Poisons
:
Singed keeps bottles of chemical poisons on his person, which he can release as a noxious green gas. Using this, Singed is able to subdue deadly foes such as
murk wolves
completely on his own.
Injected Serum
:
Singed developed a serum that would induce madness into his mutant creation, Warwick, and erase his memories. The serum was injected into Warwick during a blood transfusion which seemingly killed him; however, it was later revealed that Warwick survived the transfusion and regenerated into a mindless, savage state.
Inventor:
While Singed specializes biochemistry, he is also skilled at constructing mechanical devices, including a large number of chemtech machinery and implants and an intricate, custom-made key and music box which he keeps hidden with a locket with his
Orianna's
portrait. Singed is able to recognize great craftsmanship at a glance, shown when he examines the young Viktor's toy boat.

Relations
[

|
edit source
]

Orianna Reveck
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Singed is Orianna's father, and he loved her very much. She died a long time ago to unknown causes, and Singed would turn to increasingly disturbing and extreme methods to cure and resurrect her. These experiments would cause Singed to be cast out from the
Piltovan
academic community, but he appeared to have no regrets in the matter, believing his daughter's life far outweighed his legacy and reputation. His love would become an obsession, and there was soon no line Singed would not cross in the name of completing his research.
Singed kept his daughter's body in a chemtech preservation pod within a secret, well-kept room, where he would sometimes go to read bedtime stories to her. This room could only be unlocked by a key that was hidden in a locket with Orianna's portrait, which would play a haunting lullaby from a music box hidden inside. Singed would carry this key with him always, listening to the melody while looking at his daughter's portrait. His research towards this "cure to death" led to the creation of
Warwick
, whose blood he then used to evolve
Viktor
. Singed's attempts to revive Orianna were eventually successful, and she awoke in a new
hextech
body.

Cecil B. Heimerdinger
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Singed and Heimerdinger used to be colleagues at Piltover Academy and as a result, it can be assumed they were once close. However, as Heimerdinger could not bring himself to accept Singed's increasingly depraved experiments to cure his
Orianna's
death, and as a result Singed was dismissed from the Academy with no mention of his crime. Currently, the two scientists do not associate themselves with each other, and it's not clear as to whether Heimerdinger even knows that Singed is still alive.

Viktor
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Singed met Viktor by the Sump waters one day and seemed to view the young boy as a kindred spirit, as both a "loner" and a "gifted mind" like he was. The doctor soon took Viktor on as a pupil and would send him to collect materials which would help to save Rio's life. However, their relationship eventually fell apart when Viktor discovered the disturbing methods Singed was using to keep Rio alive, prompting the boy to abandon Singed and go off on his own. Despite this, Viktor still respected Singed for his expertise as a scientist, and eventually came to understand the reasons for Singed's methods as he too became desperate, looking for a means to cure his terminal illness. Although he had not seen Viktor in years, Singed was still willing to aid him, and took a keen interest in Viktor's
hexcore
research, while also warning him about the ostracization he'd receive by going through with his dangerous self-experimentation. After Viktor's hexcore had successfully transformed him, Singed was eager to meet with Viktor again, urging him to sacrifice
Warwick's
humanity and stabilize himself through a transfusion of his blood, claiming that Viktor's survival was paramount, as was the completion of his work. Viktor seemed to be aware that Singed was only truly after a cure for his
daughter
, and initially rejected Singed's proposal.
After Singed saved Viktor's life, Viktor expressed his gratitude as well as his admiration for the doctor's ingenuity. Viktor would soon change his mind about saving Warwick and requested Singed begin the process of his transformation, and Singed sacrificed Vander's memories to remove the limits on Viktor's power. They presumably parted on good terms.

Silco
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Singed and Silco had a typical business relationship, but Silco's position as a criminal kingpin led him to distrust Singed, as he kept the
hextech
gemstone from him despite respecting his scientific expertise. Singed was the inventor of
shimmer
, which became the drug that fueled Silco's empire, and he had a great deal of faith in his abilities, as displayed when he immediately brought
Jinx
to him to heal her after she suffered severe injuries. During the surgery, Singed offered to give Silco sedatives to stop him from seeing the agony Jinx would suffer during the operation, due to Singed empathizing with Silco as a father himself.
After Silco's death, and the deaths of the other
chembarons
, Singed would lose his primary source of funding and would eventually seek employment by the
Noxians
.

Jinx
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Singed and Jinx both served
Silco
during his reign as kingpin of
Zaun
, with Jinx being familiar enough with the doctor to believe he'd be capable of reverse-engineering
Jayce's
notes to weaponize
hextech
. When Silco rushed to his lab to save Jinx, Singed warned him that the procedure that could save her would force her into lots of physical and mental pain, or die in the worst-case scenario. When Silco insisted, Singed performed the procedure to save her as he asked, though he callously reminded her of the pain she had to go through rather than reassuring her as he injected chemicals into her.
Singed would later meet Jinx again in Stillwater Hold, where she would battle Singed's beast,
Warwick
. Singed did not converse with Jinx during this time and simply locked the door to his cell, and as he observed how Warwick reacted around her, he realized that she was the missing catalyst he'd been looking for to restore
Vander's
mind.

Warwick
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Singed collected
Vander's
body sometime after the latter's battle with
Silco
, which had heavily infused with and mutated by
shimmer
. Singed would run experiments on Vander for a number of years, combining him with the blood of
murk wolves
and
chemtech
implants to transform him into a hulking, savage beast known as Warwick. While Singed was responsible for torturing Vander with his experiments, he also expressed pity for him as a "victim of great tragedy", and had been looking for the right catalyst to recover his mind. Once Singed fell into
Ambessa's
service, he attempted to track and capture Warwick and was willing to erase Vander's memories to complete
Viktor's
transformation into the Herald, as this would allow Singed the cure to death he'd been seeking for his
daughter
. After he no longer needed him, Singed handed Warwick off to Viktor to be transformed into one of his evolved followers.

Ambessa Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Singed met Ambessa in Stillwater Hold, after the prison was attacked by his beast,
Warwick
. Realizing he was the mastermind behind the attack, Ambessa and
Caitlyn
interrogated him for information, and when he would not crack, Ambessa decided to recruit the doctor to have full, unfettered access to his
chemtech
weapons and scientific expertise. Singed was treated as a trusted advisor by Ambessa, and he would both promise her the cure to death he'd been seeking for his daughter and hunt down his beast for her, negotiating on Ambessa's behalf to make sure Warwick would remain useful to her in his savage, mindless state. Singed appeared to be obedient to Ambessa, but not afraid of her, only working for her because it was both convenient for him and she had promised to support his research. He would use his medical knowledge to try to treat the injuries of those Ambessa's warband, including
Rictus
, whom he was unable to save.
When Ambessa expressed interest in acquiring an army of
Viktor's
puppet followers, Singed helped to complete their transformation. He also supplied Ambessa with a large amount of shimmer to empower her soldiers for her assault on
Piltover
, suggesting he continued to serve Ambessa up until her death.

Caitlyn Kiramman
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Caitlyn and Singed have a hostile relationship, as she believes he is a "monster" responsible for countless deaths, due to the
chemtech beast
he created and unleashed on Stillwater. While initially suspecting he might be connected to
Jinx
, Caitlyn soon ran an investigation into Singed's past and learned he was someone far worse: the disgraced Dr. Reveck, whose crimes were too unspeakable to be kept on record. After she threatened him, Singed showed Caitlyn to his daughter's secret room, believing that she and
Orianna
might have been friends in another life. They worked together briefly in collaboration with Ambessa, until Caitlyn switched sides and joined
Vi
, incapacitating Singed. They would likely be enemies if they met again.
