Childhood

Aurora was born in the secluded village of
Aamu
as a member of a
vastayan
tribe known as the Bryni, a secluded tribe of rabbit-like vastaya that remained isolated from other vastayan tribes, causing their inherent magic to be more diluted.

Aurora was born with the innate ability to interact much more closely with the
Spirit Realm
, making many 'friends' that only she could see. Aurora's parents believed this to just be her wild imagination, but Aurora's great aunt Havu actually encouraged her unique abilities and passions, allowing her to revel in her own company.
As Aurora grew up, she started to understand her ability more, realizing these imaginary friends were actually
spirits
and that she had a special ability to peer through the veil between the mortal and spiritual realms. Using this special unique sight, Aurora meticulously documented and studied these spirits to help others understand the world as she saw it.

Meeting Haestryr

While more and more spirits appeared before Aurora during her studies, she began to discover some that felt lost between the realms, disturbed by mortal affairs. Seeking to help these spirits return to the spirit realm, she continued her research outside of Aamu and began to travel further out of the
Freljord
, nervously leaving her home behind to expand her knowledge on spirits and how to help them.
During her travels, Aurora encountered a particularly monstrous spirit in the shape of a twisted elk. The spirit was feral and afraid, lashing out with bloodstained antlers while Aurora tried to calm him down. She eventually managed to gain his trust, but her attempts to heal and help him would only end in failure. Still determined to help the elk spirit, Aurora convinced him to travel with her and used her powers to tuck him away in the spirit realm while she worked to unravel what was afflicting the elk spirit.
After encountering a number of powerful spirit walkers; shamans capable of communing with the spiritual demigods of the Freljord, they were simply at a loss at how to help the elk spirit and suggested that she sought out
Udyr
, the Freljord's most powerful spirit walker. Though Udyr immediately recognized the immense power in Aurora's new friend, he knew that the fearsome elk spirit was simply too lost to commune with and urged her to seek the demigods themselves for answers instead.

The Spirit of Hearth-Home

Sometime between the
Founding of the Freljord
and the present, Aurora ventured into
Hearth-Home
seeking a way to help her new-found
Spirit
friend. When she approached
Ornn
, the Spirit of Hearth-Home, he dismissed her, claiming he was too busy to help. Undeterred, Aurora busied herself by tidying and reorganizing Hearth-Home, which greatly pleased Ornn.
Impressed by her efforts, Ornn apologized for his earlier brusqueness and revealed the location where Aurora could find information about her spirit friend, whose name was revealed to be
Haestryr
. As a gesture of their new-found friendship, Ornn forged a wand for Aurora, granting her the ability to create portals at will.
Aurora eventually left
Hearth-Home
to seek answers about Haestryr, but she often returns to visit her grumpy friend Ornn and reminisce about the past.

and even fully fusing both the Spirit and
Material Realm
to create a
rift.
