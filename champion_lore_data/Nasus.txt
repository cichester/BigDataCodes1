Thoughtful and reclusive, Nasus is an imposing, solemn presence, bearing all the power, wisdom, and sorrow that comes with millennia of life. Primarily a keeper of knowledge, he is not one to rush to violence despite being a fearsome combatant.

When the Shurima Empire still existed, Nasus fought alongside other Ascended hosts including those that would later become the
Darkin
. Nasus was a warrior scholar who spearheaded the military and cultural uprising of Ancient Shurima, but
Azir's
misled
arrogance
led to the empire's downfall, costing him his own brother
Renekton
. Nasus was forced to imprison his own brother with the betrayer
Xerath
, who would later drive Renekton into madness. After being freed, Renekton started to hunt down Nasus, believing he was the cause of all his suffering. Nasus hopes he can cure
Renekton
of his madness, so that the united brothers might defeat
Xerath
and restore Shurima to greatness together with their resurrected emperor
Azir
.

to escape alongside other citizens.
