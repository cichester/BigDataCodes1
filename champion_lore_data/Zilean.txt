Zilean was born and raised in
Icathia
, becoming an elemental mage with an exquisite knowledge of physical reality. He studied under many great minds of the time, including the Yun of
Ixtal
. He spent much of his time trying to master the element of time, but could not find success.

Fall of Icathia

When he was a young man, Zilean was appointed to Icathia's governing council of distinguished mages, philosophers, and lawmakers. Now in a political establishment, Zilean realized that discontentment was growing among the people of Icathia. Despite being part of the empire of
Shurima
, the Icathians were not treated as equals by their superiors. As such, many considered secession. However, Zilean knew that Icathia would lose any battle, as Shurima's power eclipsed that of Icathia, with
Ascended
soldiers being Shurima's strongest weapons.
After coming back from a diplomatic voyage in which he had failed to convince Icathia's allies to support their secession, Zilean found out that his fellow mages had found a way to harness the power of
The Void
. While he warned against it, the mages ignored his warnings and tried to use the harnessed power in battle. The magic of The Void overpowered the mages that used it and spread through Icathia. As Icathia was swallowed into The Void, Zilean gathered as many people into his tower as possible before removing the tower and all of its inhabitants from time. Everyone and everything that Zilean had removed, save for Zilean himself, was frozen in time. Zilean learned to control the anomaly that he made, learning to move through the past and present, attempting to succeed in his efforts. But as he attempted to do this, he found out that
Runeterra
was in danger of being completely destroyed.
Resolving to save the world from this fate, Zilean left his anomaly and began his quest to save Runeterra.
