Early Life
[

Sejuani was born of a
Freljord
political marriage, daughter of the Warmother of the
Winter's Claw
, Kalkia. But her mother would quickly abandon the role of Warmother, instead pursuing another man she had her eyes on, leaving the tribe in chaos. Instead, Sejuani was raised by her Grandmother Heijan, a cold and uncaring mother figure who's expectations Sejuani could never seem to meet.
The Winter's Claw was left poor from the neglect of Kalkia, but during a visit to the
Avarosan
, Sejuani saw how well people could have it under a competent warmother. During her visit, Sejuani was taken in by the famous warrior and warmother, Grena, who Sejuani learned had once bested Kalkia in a duel, an act that earned Sejuani's adoration. It was also here she met with Grena's only daughter,
Ashe
, who became Sejuani's best and only friend. Though things quickly turned sour as Grena started to openly question Heijan's treatment of Sejuani, an act which infuriated Heijan. Heijan cut all ties with the Avarosan and started expanding into the surrounding tribes, which only further weakened the Winter's Claw.
Word reached Kalkia about the failiures of the Winter's Claw, which brought her return where she proclaimed herself Warmother again. Sejuani was enraged by her mother's return and started secretly plotting to overthrow her and become the new warmother.
During an expedition, Sejuani once more met with Ashe, who was starving and alone in
Ursine
lands after the
Frostguard
had destroyed the rest of the Avarosan. Sejuani took pity on her old friend and brought her back to the Winter's Claw, an act which the new warmother and the
Frostguard
did not take kindly. Sejuani told Ashe about her plan to overthrow Kalkia and asked for Ashe's help, to which she agreed and they both swore and oath, making them Battlesisters. Though this friendship was short lived, for unbeknownst to Ashe; Sejuani's plan involved raiding and destroying the neighbouring tribe, the Ebrataal Tribe, to steal their supplies. Ashe did not approve of this raid and the two former battlesisters were now sworn enemies.
After Ashe's betrayal, Sejuani completed another raid agaisnt a
Noxus
Warship, hoping it would be enough to rally the tribes in support of Sejuani. During this raid, Sejuani freed
Bristle
from the ship's slaughterhouse, who would become her most royal steed. This raid proved enough, and Sejuani returned back to the Winter's Claw to challenge her mother to a duel, an act which was extremely taboo. Sejuani won decisively, killing her mother in the process.
Sejuani was now the new warmother and did not waste a second, she immediately began raiding and absorbing nearby tribes while also throwing out the Frostguard. Sejuani had taken the Winter's Claw from the brink of collapse and ruin, and had turned it into the most feared and brutal tribe of the Freljord.

The Freljord is currently undergoing the harshest winter in living memory, and the Winter's Claw are starving because of it. Sejuani, after returning from a failed hunting mission, found herself at a loss of what to do. That's when a old man from a village she destroyed requested to speak with her. The old man should have starved weeks ago and Sejuani was intrigued over how he was still alive, where he mentioned that he had eaten from the
Cauldron of Ornn
, a legendary artifact with the ability to fully feed anyone who eats from it for, leaving them full for several weeks. But the Cauldron had been stolen by the
Volibear
and is deep in Ursine territory. Sejuani decided to take a gamble, believing the old mans story, and is now on an
expedition
into Ursine lands to steal the Cauldron, joined by
Olaf
, in hopes that it will be able to save her starving people.

Sejuani and Ashe were once childhood friends but were seperated when Ashe's mother offended Sejuani's grandmother, Heijan, over how she was raising Sejuani. Years later, Sejuani found Ashe starving in
Ursine
lands after the
Frostguard
annihilated the rest of her tribe. Sejuani and Ashe became battlesisters the next day, but had a falling out during a raid against the Ebrataal Tribe, a raid which Ashe did not approve of.
Sejuani now considers Ashe and her new tribe an enemy to the Winters Claw and a traitor to the Spirit of the Freljord. She views her peacekeeping and agricultural ways as a complete betrayl to Grena, Ashes mother who Sejuani respected, and to her legacy.

Olaf once fought against the Winter's Claw, seeking a good death, which ultimately ended in Sejuani and Olaf battling eachother. It seemed Sejuani and Olaf were equally strong and as the battle neared a standstill, Sejuani offered Olaf to fight for the Winter's Claw where he would surely come across a good death, which he gladly accepted.
