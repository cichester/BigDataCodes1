Early life
[
edit

edit source
]

Shen was the son of Master Kusho, the previous Eye of Twilight of the Kinkou, whose role was to maintain the equilibrium between the spirit and physical realms. As Shen grew up, he was a good student when it came to learning the Kinkou teachings such as
Pruning the Tree
,
Coursing the Sun
, and
Watching the Stars
, and he was also able to make decisions dispassionately and without prejudice.
When Zed (then known as Govos) was invited into the Kinkou order, Shen was initially much stronger than the newcomer. But Zed was a fast learner and his abilities soon rivaled Shen, but he lacked Shen’s dispassion. Yet they grew up as brothers.
At one point, Kusho, Shen, and Zed set out to hunt down the Golden Demon, a murderer who had plagued the province of Zhyun. When they captured the Golden Demon, it turned out to be Jihn, a stagehand from a traveling theater. Shen was ready to accept his father’s wish to imprison the murderer while Zed wanted to get revenge by killing him instead.

Shen leads the surviving
Kinkou
which has a great conflict of interest with
Zed's
Order of Shadow and its defiance of Ionia's sacred balance.
Kennen
remains by his side while
Akali
went rogue. She and
Shen
parted on neutral terms. Neither hates the other but both disapprove of the other's methods.

After
Akali
and
Zed
made their choice, Shen is starting to doubt whether the old way still works.

Zed
[

]

Shen and
Zed
are childhood friends and used to consider each other as brother before
Zed
"murdered" Master Kusho. Master Kusho, Shen, and Zed were responsible for capturing and imprisoning
Khada Jhin
, but were traumatised by the Golden Demon's actions in the process. Later on, when Jhin was set free again, Zed sought out Shen in order to inform him about Jhin's reappearance and to team up with him to stop him. Shen, despite still wishing to avenge his father's death, accepted the truce for the greater good. The duo later saved a captured
Akali
from
Jhin
and caught him. Shen is torn between killing Zed to avenge his father Kusho (the Kinkou's previous master and wielder of the
spirit blade
) and enforcing equilibrium with the spirit realm (his duty takes priority, but he won't hesitate if given the chance). Zed could have revealed the truth about Kusho to Shen but then decided it was better for Shen to be disillusioned with Zed than to be disillusioned with his own father. That's probably not fair, and maybe Shen has a right to know. But Zed is flawed... and blinded by his need to feel he's worthy and honorable.
