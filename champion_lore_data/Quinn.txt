Early life

Quinn and her twin brother Caleb were born in
Uwendale
to a weaponsmith and a ranger. When
7
King Jarvan III
visited the village, they were impressed by the knights in their shining armor, and began to imitate them. Their father supported them in their endeavors, but as they grew older, the children took after their mother and spent time ranging in the wilds.
As young adults, Quinn and her brother were a formidable team of rangers, proficient in tracking and hunting prey. Quinn used a bow, while Caleb used a spear.

Death of Caleb
[

Quinn and Caleb were hired to accompany a hunting parting of nobles from the capital. The nobles hunted a giant
Tuskvore
, but did not manage to kill it. The wounded beast turned on the hunters, and the twins intervened. As they drove off the creature, it killed Caleb. The leader of the nobles,
2
Lord Barrett Buvelle
, helped Quinn bury her brother, who saved their life.
The death of Caleb broke Quinn, she couldn't focus on her tasks and would often make mistakes in the wilderness. A few months after the incident, Lady Lestara
Buvelle
visited Quinn's family and asked what her house could do for the grieving family. Quinn did not have an answer for her; She politely thanked her for the offer and turned her away.

The bond with Valor

One year after Caleb's death, Quinn returned to his grave as she often did. Due to her carelessness, she was taken by surprise when a tuskvore attacked her. She noticed it was the same beast that killed her brother, from the eye he took out before his death. Quinn fought the tuskvore, but found that she couldn't win. Just as it was about to kill her too, an
Azurite Eagle
swooped in and distracted the creature. With this help, Quinn managed to kill the tuskvore.
She nursed the wounded bird back to health and named him
Valor
. The connection she felt with the eagle helped Quinn, and she once again contemplated how to serve
Demacia
. With help from her father, she crafted her repeater crossbow, then journeyed to the
capital
to become a ranger-knight.

Fragile Legacies

At the funeral of Lord Barrett Buvelle, Quinn spoke with his widow Lestara Buvelle. Lestara expressed her gratitude for saving his life two years ago, and asked again how she could repay Quinn. Quinn hesitated at first, then asked Lady Buvelle to sponsor her for knighthood. Lestara agreed and spoke with
Tianna Crownguard
, and Quinn became a ranger-knight in the same week.
As ranger-knight, Quinn served in the Demacian military with her companion Valor. She has traveled far across Runeterra in her missions, including

Shield of Remembrance

In the late autumn of
996 AN
, Quinn received orders from
Tianna Crownguard
. She was to meet with
Garen
and a detachment of the
Dauntless Vanguard
and escort them to
Nockmirch
, but was distracted by a burned cabin in the woods. There she met up with
3
Greenfang Warden
Dalin, and decided to pursue the attackers. They tracked the group to the eastern border, where Quinn confronted them. She learned that the widow and her child who lived in the cabin were not abducted, but that she willingly returned to
Skaggorn
with her brother. It was forbidden to leave the country due to the ongoing rebellion, but the group knew of a secret passage unknown to the Demacian guards. Quinn decided to still let them go, ordering Dalin to stand down. She then told him to ensure a watchtower was built so this could not happen again, and ran off to make her original assignment.

Garen: First Shield

After running through the forest for multiple days and nights, Quinn met with the Dauntless Vanguard and boarded the ship
"Stormbright"
. As ranger, it was her duty to scout ahead and make sure the environment was safe. She was the one to discover a fortified bridge spanning the ravine between
Rijenland
and
Alderburg
, and later discovered the
noxian army
nearby. She rushed back to Alderburg to alert
Garen
, and they left with the Vanguard. Quinn was supposed to make it back to Demacia and alert them, but she was wounded while trying to open the gates of the bridge for the trapped soldiers. Valor, despite also being wounded, made it out and managed to lead
5
Silverwing riders
to the trapped Demacians. Quinn and the survivors then made it back to the
Great City
to recover from their wounds.
