Early Life
[

As a young girl, Seraphine developed a passion for music of all kinds. This passion only grew after her Mother's departure, leaving just her and her father in their Piltovian home. As she grew older Seraphine began to develop her magical powers, however her power was so strong that she quickly began to feel overwhelmed and could not hear herself which caused her to begin trying to repress them. Her father, seeing the anguish his daughter was going through, created special hearing aids that would help her stabilize her powers. Seraphine's subtle updates to her stage and "secret" underground trips to Zaun continued throughout her adolescent years, as she grew even more involved with the antics of the war, finding her place in the conflict. Soon it became evident that her father was both aware and proud of her musical antics, seeing his previous dream of sharing his songs with the world in his daughter.

Concerts in Zaun

At some point, Seraphine met Acorn, her chipmunk companion (otherwise known as "the Hextechnician"), who began accompanying her on her undisclosed trips underground. Seraphine's father began helping her with her equipment, touching up her guitar after long concerts, while she focused on making her disguise as flashy as possible.
Seraphine slowly began building her reputation throughout Zaun, performing soulful concerts and attracting large groups of its citizens, who were dazed and intrigued by her colorful, powerful songs. She actively began competing with other popular performers underground, including the infamous Zaun Diva, Scratch, both impressed with the other's musical capabilities.

Seraphine is a warm, friendly person and very fond of music, when she was a child she liked to play in her parents' workshop when her magic power grew she became somewhat withdrawn as she heard many voices and could not hear herself, her parents created some special hearing aids for her that helped her control that power.
When she came down to the city of Zaun, she was overcome with many emotions, most of them negative due to Piltover's contempt for Zaun. When she sang for the first time at the border of the two cities, she proudly saw how the people of both cities lived in harmony, so she set herself a goal that through her music she would unite the two neighboring cities.

Abilities

Mage
: Seraphine was born with the magical ability to hear the emotions and souls of others, an ability that might grow the more she trains and expands her knowledge about magic. Due to her initial attempt to suppress her abilities rather than embrace them, she isn't formally trained in her magic but utilizes it nonetheless for her performances.
Empathetic Sound Magic:
Seraphine can magically hear the emotions of others through an intense form of empathy, allowing her to hear the true thoughts and emotions of an individual. Her hearing is so intense and acute that she initially had to use a dampening device to keep from hearing the discordant emotions of the entirety of
Piltover
and
Zaun
combined. Eventually, Seraphine began to embrace her magic and is now capable of hearing the thoughts, feelings and memories of entire crowds. Along with that, she can create her own music to influence others' emotions, most notably singing songs of unity and compassion.
Sound Projection
: Seraphine can manipulate sound waves and use them to create concentrated magical energy which she uses to launch energy beams  or shape it to create energy shields. Although she does not like violence, she does not hesitate to use her powers to defend herself.
Healing Magic
: Through certain magical songs, Seraphine can heal wounds.
Musical Mastery:
Seraphine is extremely musically talented, having a magnificent and beautiful voice along with skill in playing several instruments such as her custom-made hexcoustic guitar.
Hextech Music Platform:
Seraphine often performs on top of her custom made Hextech musical platform as a stage. This device was crafted after Seraphine dismantled her hearing dampener, choosing to embrace her magic as her parents created the platform stage as a Hextech amplifier of her powers, allowing her to more fully hear the thoughts and feelings of people as well as amplify her own magical music. Though she isn't very combative, Seraphine can also use her platform to produce powerful soundwaves.

Seraphine understands the
brackerns
' singing language to an extent thanks to her magical hearing, therefore she comprehends the song from the hextech crystal in her platform. She'd probably be the only human able to communicate well with
Skarner
. However, she does not know that they seek help, and they do enjoy her songs of togetherness.

Millie

Millie is one of Seraphine's biggest fans and the leader of her fan club. While she is too shy to engage in conversation before leaving, Seraphine still enjoys talking with Millie.

Scratch

Scratch has a friendly rivalry towards Seraphine, with both having enjoyment performing together. Judging by her flustered reaction when Acoustician tells her Seraphine talks about her a lot, Scratch's feelings toward Seraphine may be greater than just simple friendship.
