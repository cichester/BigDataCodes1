Appearance
[

Even as a human, Nautilus was described as a large man, a "quick-sinking hulk of solid muscle."
[
1
]
After he drowned, Nautilus awoke even larger, a spirit housed without his great metal diving suit that had grown into an enormous, titanic monstrosity who was larger than most ships, with massive metal gauntlets and giant boots that pounded across the seafloor. Having sat beneath the waves for centuries, Nautilus's suit has grown rusted and brown and covered in cracks and barnacles. His eyes are visible from within the dark casing as glowing orange lights, and the cracks in his suit glow with an eerie, ghost-like green color, emphasizing his nature as an
undead
. As a weapon he carries an enormous
anchor
attached to a
line
, which he uses to sink ships below the waves.

Personality
[

edit source
]

Nautilus was a very superstitious man in life, and he would never set out to sea without first appeasing the
vast ocean
by "paying the tithe".
[

]
He maintains this mindset after becoming a
revenant
, and will sink any ship that crosses his path should they forget to drop a coin into the ocean. Nautilus never tires of this mission, making him dutiful but also ruthless and vengeful against those who would disrespect the sea, but generally spares those who show the Bearded Lady proper reverence.
Nautilus has a slow, deliberate manner of speaking. He likes to make his voice as deep as possible, so as to intimidate people. He is also a very old and ancient being who appears to miss his youth as he watches the excitable young sea creatures in the ocean around him.

Abilities

Revenant Physiology
:
As an undead, Nautilus is bound to his armored diving suit and does not need to eat or breathe, allowing him to remain underwater for as long as he wishes.
Cursed Diving Suit:
Nautilus's great metal diving suit, which houses his spirit, has grown to a titanic size, becoming virtually indestructible to all who may seek to destroy him.
Powers of the Ocean:
After his death, Nautilus was blessed with an ancient power which allows him to command the
waves
from beneath the
depths
.
Anchor:
Torn from his captain's ship, Nautilus wields an enormous anchor as a weapon. Should any ship try to escape him, Nautilus can
extend
the anchor's reach by its chain, so that he may pull them to the depths below.

While he was a human, Nautilus was a strong believer in appeasing the
ocean
and would always request that his captains throw a coin overboard in order to appease her. Now, having become the Titan of the Depths, Nautilus continues to carry out his interpretation of the Bearded Lady's will, and shows no signs of growing tired of his mission.

While the
Gangplank
-
Miss Fortune
combined armada fought
the Black Mist
on
Bilgewater's
shores (eventually succeeding but at great cost) Nautilus managed to stall and/or defeat the rest of the undead threat a few miles from the port city itself.

Nautilus has a fondness for many of the sea creatures, like the
2
Coral Creatures
,
3
Bubble Bear
,
1
Admiwal Shelly and Nurtle
. There are some he finds annoying though, like
4
Zap Sprayfin
, possibly because she is friends with
Fizz
.

Fizz

Nautilus hates
Fizz
and would like to see him dead.

Miss Fortune

Nautilus encountered
Miss Fortune
once before when he arrived to collect the debt of the Moon Serpent and its captain, Aligh. Miss Fortune survived the encounter, but only because Nautilus was after Aligh, not her.

Having nearly been claimed by the depths once before,
Gangplank
refuses to pay the Bearded Lady's tithe out of spite, not seeming to believe Nautilus truly exists.
