Listen to Their Tale

Tales of the
spirit god
known as the Kindred go back millennia, making it difficult to determine their true origin. Some of the earliest legends tell the story of 'a pale man with dark hair' who was very lonely, as all things would have to meet this man at the hour of their death. For this the people shunned him, so the lonely man took an axe and split himself in two so he 'would always have a friend'. According to the legend, these two halves became the
Lamb
and the
Wolf
, the eternal companions who would stalk the continent and hunt all things. Forever separate, yet together always, they worked as one to shepherd the souls of
Runeterra
into the
afterlife
.

Legends and Folklore
[

At some point in early history, a pair of masks were found carved into the remains of ancient gravesites. These masks helped spread the earliest stories of the Kindred across all of Runeterra, with every major nation having some variation or interpretation of the Kindred myth. Some, like
Demacia
, revered the Lamb's swift and true arrows, while
Noxus
strove for fierce and violent battles to escape the Wolf. The
Freljord
was known to honor the Wolf's chase by watering the battlefield in their enemies' blood, while in
Bilgewater
, people would throw festivals to honor the people granted a 'true death', rather than being claimed by the
Harrowing
. Even on the
Shadow Isles
, a perverse expanse where every undead soul is trapped in a waking nightmare, there are none who can escape the Kindred, as they are certain to outlast the Isles' curse.
As these many versions of the tale spread, so too did reenactments, with people wearing masks as they imitated the calm grace of the Lamb and the playful savagery of the Wolf.

One of the great bards of
Valoran
, Soates, wrote the Kindred Fables on her deathbed as she descended into madness. Her final narrative,
Lambs in the Orchard
, famously went unfinished before she died. During the reign of King Jarvan II, a playwright named Tarnold was hired by a noblewoman to write and direct an ending to Soates' incomplete work. He and his troupe were able to finish Soates' masterpiece after they all wore masks to channel the spirits of death, including Lamb, Wolf, a
6
Vulture
, and a
2
maskmaker
. When it came time to perform, however, the actors stood lifeless, as the ending was meant only for those who wore masks.

Still Here

As
Tryndamere
was fighting enemy warriors in the snow, he collapsed and fell on the brink of death. When he rose up, he saw the Kindred approach him. Tryndamere rejected a swift death from
Lamb
and entered a
rage
, cutting through her arrows and even her bow with his blade, while also fending off numerous attacks from the
Wolf
. When Kindred was about to claim him, they suddenly backed away as
Ashe
arrived and killed the enemy warriors, who were about to stab Tryndamere in the back. Tryndamere's rage ended, and he found himself surrounded by the enemy corpses, while Kindred was nowhere to be seen.

Appearance
[

edit source
]

As a spirit god, Kindred is an entity with many names and forms across many different cultures. Their primary appearance, which is their oldest and most prevalent representation, is the
Lamb
and the
Wolf
.

Lamb
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Lamb, as her name would suggest, looks like a lamb with pale fur, standing with her hind legs on cloven hooves. She doesn't wear clothes, as her body is covered in white fur. The most distinctive ornament on her attire is the
"wolf" mask which has a dark color, with cool lights glowing through the large eye sockets. She carries with her a silver, mystical bow, which she uses as a weapon.

Wolf
[

]

Wolf, as his name would suggest, is an enormous spectral wolf with dark fur, often only appearing as a jagged maw within a dark cloud. He wears no clothes, as the rest of his body is covered in a long, spectral dark veil. On occasion, Wolf can manifest legs as he charges down his prey, appearing much larger and more monstrous than an ordinary wolf. The most distinctive ornament on his attire is the
"lamb" mask which is white in color, with cool lights glowing through the large eye sockets.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

In the beginning, Kindred was a single being, isolated from the others due to their nature as a god of death. Lonely and craving companionship, they took an axe and cut themself into two beings, Lamb and Wolf. Both are deeply attached to each other, existing separately but acting as one.

Lamb
[

|
edit source
]

Lamb is the calm and graceful marksman that swiftly and painlessly ends the life of those that accept death by shooting them down with a single well aimed arrow. Should they run away from their fate, they will find themselves in the maw of Wolf. Lamb appears to be Kindred's primary decision maker and is often the one directing Wolf towards their goal or explaining the emotions of others to him. She is highly knowledgeable about the people of Runeterra, but is detached from them, treating them as nothing more than stories to be told. Despite being calmer and less prone to violence than Wolf, Lamb is noticeably more apathetic towards others.

Wolf
[

]

Wolf is the bestial half of the Kindred, representing a violent death. Those who will not fall to Lamb's arrows doom themselves to Wolf's jaws as he goes on the chase. Always hungry, he feels emotion but does not truly understand it - the counterpart to Lamb's impassive knowledge of feelings. The Kindred stalk the world, bringing peaceful death to those who will fall by Lamb. All who do not make one more chase for Wolf, and he pursues his prey with a gleeful and savage excitement. Wolf enjoys hearing stories from Lamb and will often ask her questions, which she is always ready to answer.

Abilities

Spirit God Physiology
:
Kindred is an ancient divine being embodying a particular aspect of the world, in this case, death. Kindred nurtures themselves from both their role as death gods and from the belief and memory of worshipers.
Immortality:
So long as there is life on Runeterra and there still be people that believe in them, Kindred will continue existing.
Spiritual Connection:
Both parts of the Kindred are connected to each other through a powerful spiritual bond.
Avatar of Death:
Kindred is a god of death, responsible for the passing of living beings to the afterlife. Kindred will come to those that are close to death and can either take them to the beyond or grant them
respite
to allow them to live longer. Whether Kindred chooses the death or they're simply drawn to those close to death seems to vary. If the dying person chooses a peaceful death, then Lamb will take them swiftly with one of their
arrows
. If they choose to fight death, then Wolf will give
chase
. The nature of the "choice" is not always clear and obvious, as many have chosen without knowing, due to living a life that put them in the path of one of the Kindred.

Relations

Grey Man

Lamb
and
Wolf
(or any other 2 forms of Kindred) consider each other their only friend. In
Spirit Bonds
, it was implied certain parts of the Grey Man still exist somewhere in the Spirit Realm.

Other Representations of Death
[

edit source
]

As a god of death, Kindred is related to all other representations of deaths in Runeterra. Some legends say the
2
Mask Mother
created Kindred. While it's unknown how true the story is, both Lamb and Wolf call her their mother. At the end of
Soates' final play
, it is suggested that once the Kindred are forgotten (or when all living things have died out),
Lamb
and
Wolf
will kill each other, while
6
The Etherfiend
will feast away on what's left.

Ambessa Medarda
[

]

When Ambessa was gravely wounded at the battlefield of
Rokrund
, a lone
Wolf
approached her, whom she recognized as a harbinger of the Kindred. As she was on the brink of death, Kindred took Ambessa to
Volrachnun
and gave her two tests. The first was a test of combat against
the Shield
. The second was a test of will and sacrifice. For passing her trials, Ambessa was rewarded a vision of her sitting on the throne of the
Noxian
empire, which she could claim should she choose to return to the realm of the living.
[

Ambessa's meeting with the Kindred alloyed her resolve and ambition, and she would make it her personal mantra to always be as fearsome and merciless as the Wolf.

Tryndamere

Tryndamere has bested death repeatedly as a result of his
undying rage
. Kindred nearly claimed Tryndamere during one of his near-death experiences, but vanished after
Ashe
saved him from enemy warriors.

Fiddlesticks

Fiddlesticks, an equally ancient entity, is one of the only champions to refer to Kindred prior to their split, calling out to Kindred as the
"Grey man..."

Karthus
[

]

After the tally-men of Kindred collected the bodies of Karthus' sisters, as was custom in the parts of
Noxus
where they lived, Karthus followed them, asking them questions about their line of work. The tally-men of Kindred soon accepted Karthus into their ranks, first as a grave digger, then a pyre builder, then a corpse collector. Eventually, Karthus worked in the temple of the tally-men, tending to the sick in their final moments. Now, as an undead, Karthus still wears the tally-men's vestments and carries the staff, which he still etches every time he 'releases' a mortal soul from life.
