Early Life

Saijax Cail-Rynx Icathâ€™un was born and raised in
Icathia
, a vassal-state of the
Shuriman Empire
. He was raised by his father, who along with the other people of Icathia harbored resentment towards the Empire because of the fact that their great nation had been taken over by it. He would tell Jax stories of the Kohari, a group of heroes who served the Mage King, the title given to the ruler of Icathia before it was taken over. The Mage King had resisted the Shuriman acquisition of Icathia, but he was defeated in battle. In his honor, the Kohari committed ritual suicide, as was customary for their order. The corpses of the Kohari and the Mage King were paraded around the city by the Empire for all to see as a warning of the consequences of resistance.
Saijax's father passed down this resentment towards the Empire to his son, and Saijax started the study of arms, learning from Shurima's weapon masters and his clan's elders.

Fall of Icathia

One day, a massive earthquake struck the coastal province of Saabera. This quake unearthed something hidden deep within the earth that Icathia's mages recognized could help them defeat the Shuriman Empire and gain their independence. Saijax was tasked with protecting and escorting the mages while they traveled, and he saw that the mages could barely contain what they had found with brazier staves with magical fire. This power would be come to be known as
The Void
.
Saijax was worried about the safety of using The Void as a weapon. As a master of weapons, he knew the danger of using a weapon they couldn't understand or control. He would come to regret not killing the mages when he had the chance.
Confident that they could win with the powers of The Void, the people of Icathia crowned a new Mage King and rebuilt the Kohari, with Saijax among the first to join their ranks. They won early engagements with the Shuriman troops and Saijax even defeated an
Ascended
warrior. Soon, even more Ascended and troops arrived to fight against Icathia. Saijax was on the front lines and fought many troops, stopping them from advancing into their home. As the battle raged, the mages unleashed the power of The Void, killing many Shuriman troops. However, the mages lost control of it quickly and it started consuming everything around it, including the entirety of Icathia. Saijax, seeing that it was lost, left Icathia to be destroyed. He eventually returned to where Icathia once stood, ready to commit ritual suicide like the Kohari of old. However, before he could do it, he saw a brazier stave that was used to contain The Void and he saw that it was still burning. He saw the hope that it represented and picked it up and left. He forsook his name in shame and was henceforth known as Jax.

Jax has committed himself to rebuilding the Kohari and fighting The Void in Shurima. The flame inside the brazier stave that he now uses as a weapon burned lower the farther he went from Icathia, making him realize that he cannot run from his past. He has fought a great many people, but none have been skilled enough. He will not stop until he has rebuilt the Kohari and can finally take on The Void.

Jax wears purple robes with blue tinted stripes and patterns in various places. He carries with him a brazier stave used to contain elemental fire that can harm The Void. His most defining feature is his mask with six glowing blue "eyes" that covers his entire face.
It is not known what he looks like underneath his mask. However, during the events of Icathia's destruction, he was described as having a shaven head, a forked beard, and skin pockmarked by a childhood illness.
