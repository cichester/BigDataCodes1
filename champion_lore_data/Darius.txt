Childhood
[

edit source
]

Born in
Basilich
, Darius was as an orphan alongside his younger brother
Draven
. He struggled hard to provide for both himself and his brother and protected the latter from anyone who tried to harm him, even the city guard. Darius spent a majority of his childhood fighting for survival, with constant fights leaving permanent scars on himself. He and Draven were friends with a girl named
Quilletta Varn
, whom saved him from falling off a cliff that they were climbing. Darius developed a relationship with Quilletta, having ambitions to conquer the world alongside her.
When an
Noxian
army led by their captain Cyrus invaded Basilich, the three children hid atop a rooftop. Quilletta was reluctant towards the harsh choice between joining Noxus or being killed, but Darius contemplated paying the consequences since he didn't want to leave Draven behind. To his horror, Draven attempted to throw a knife to fight them but ended up hitting Cyrus' flag, leading to the three to get apprehended by the soldiers. After hearing Draven's boasts, Cyrus invited the kids to ally with Noxus.

In Noxus

Growing to adulthood in Noxus, Darius married Quilletta and became a father to two: Decius and
Invetia
. He and Draven served as soldiers under Cyrus' warhost, engaging in many war campaigns and stopping rebellions against
Boram Darkwill's
throne. Darius quickly rose through the ranks, embodying the values of Noxus through his aggression, bravery and patriotism. In one battle, after a general ordered a retreat, Darius saw him as a coward and beheaded him out of defiance, rallying the fearful troops and securing a victory. He was rewarded by being promoted to senior commander, which attracted many Noxians to join his army but he only accepted those with the greatest strength and discipline. Feared to the point where cities surrendered at the sight of Darius' banners, his victory against the Varju got him promoted to the Hand of Noxus by Darkwill himself.
As the new Hand of Noxus, Darius and his army were sent to the Freljord to conquer it, enduring countless assassination attempts, a conflictive territorial dispute between the
trolls
under
Trundle's
command in the steppes at the borders of the icy lands, and a capture from the
Winter's Claw
before ending in a stalemate after a long, grueling conflict. He headed back to Noxus to request a reconsolidation of the military, but found that Darkwill had been assassinated and usurped by
Jericho Swain
, as part of his coup which even Draven had backed. Darius began to respect Swain's accomplishments and was prepared to serve him, but he gave Darius a place in the
Trifarian Legion
, representing the Noxian principle of Might alongside Swain as Vision and the Faceless as Guile.
However, Quilletta was starting to become disillusioned towards Noxus after witnessing the horrific aftermath of
Singed
's chemical bomb in Ionia, which caused her arm to be amputated as a result of the poison, and their son Decius dying in the campaign against the Freljord. Quilletta expressed her worries to Darius, but he dismissed her saying that Noxus required mercilessness and sacrifice because the empire had to conquer and losing one city would be severely detrimental. Finally having enough, Quilletta snapped from her grief towards Decius' death only to be killed by Invetia, believing her to be weak. Horrified, Darius asked Invetia about her merciless act, and she cited the Noxian philosophy and how she learned it from him.

Darius is a large, bulky man with a serious, intense face and middle-aged features. He has fair skin and swept-back black hair with a white streak. His eyes are variously portrayed as either red, green or gray. He also has a long, straight scar over his left eye.
Darius wears heavy full plate armor that leaves only his head and his upper arms exposed. It is dark gray, intricately crafted, and accentuated with spikes around the shoulders and thighs. It also features a long cape and loin cloth, both blood red, symbolizing Noxus.
His weapon of choice is a massive two-handed axe, viciously curved and forged with a symbol of a skull where the blade meets the handle.

Personality

Stern and warlike, Darius is unwaveringly dedicated to Noxus and its ideals. He is a soldier without parallel, balancing ruthless mettle with sound strategy. He stands confident and firm, showing no tolerance for weakness or cowardice. Despite his intimidating demeanor, however, Darius is also deeply committed to fostering the strength of others wherever he can find it, elevating those he finds deserving and crushing those who have not earned their status.

Abilities

Master Axeman
:
Through his countless battles within the Noxian campaigns, Darius became very adept at using his battle axe in combat. He became so feared that he would make cities surrender by the mere sight of his banners as well as grant him the miltary title of Hand of Noxus.
Extreme Resilience:
From a young age, Darius exhibited remarkable resilience to injury and pain. His body bears the visible scars of numerous battles, a testament to his enduring strength. Born an urchin in
Basilich
and the elder brother to
Draven
, Darius had to fight not only to survive but also to provide for his sibling. This innate toughness became even more apparent during his military campaigns.
Charisma:
Darius is very charismatic in the eyes of the Noxian troops. After a general ordered a retreat, Darius saw him as a coward and beheaded him out of defiance, rallying the fearful troops and securing a victory. He is also known to accept anyone who is willing and able to fight for their ideals, no matter the cost.

Relations

Swain

Darius was accoladed by Darkwill, but allied with
Swain
because he sees in the Master Tactician someone who can make Noxus rise.

Sion
[

edit source
]

In Darius' eyes
necromancy
is cheating death to justify one's undeserved continued survival.
[

]
Yet for him,
Sion's
legacy is an example. Though when he gazes upon the Undead Juggernaut, he sees what might become of himself should he no longer be useful to the empire (or rather, too useful, should death come knocking).

Garen
[

Darius holds no grudge against
Garen
. However, he considers him a fool bound by a meaningless code of "honor." Despite this, he would relish killing
Garen
simply to prove
Noxian Might
crushes all, even Demacian
Perseverance
,
Courage
, and
Justice
â€”especially a paragon of said values.

Draven
[

]

Darius and his younger brother
Draven
are renowned as the "Blood Brothers." Family ties are strong and can serve as the basis for one's strength, yet Darius sees self-serving aristocrats using theirs as a crutch for their weakness, and as a result, the perpetuation of stagnant leadership that needs to be removed and replaced. With this in mind, one cannot tell if Darius providing and caring for
Draven
during their childhood came out of love or even mere pragmatism. The comic
Blood of Noxus
seems to imply the former.

Family
[

]

He has 2 children (Decius and
Invetia Varn
) mothered by his former lover,
Quilletta Varn
. They never married given the pragmatism of Noxus, and knowing the likely trajectory of their lives at war.
[

]
She was murdered by their daughter
Invetia
during the
Battle of Basilich
.
While it was never explicitly confirmed that they are his children, it was heavily implied due to the relationship between Darius and Quilletta as well as some localizations using terms indicative of blood relation.
Seeing the approval of the slaughtering of innocents by
Singed
and Emystan made
Quilletta Varn
grow more disillusioned about the empire's ambitions, which led her to rebel against the empire, among the other events of the story.

Trundle
[

During his campaign in the
Freljord
, Darius fought Trundle and was nearly killed by him. Darius' axe was frozen by Trundle's
True Ice
club, but he was able to use it to knock the king of the trolls unconscious, with his arm becoming injured and frozen in the process.

During a Black Mist attack caused by
Viego
at
The Immortal Bastion
, Darius was temporarily possessed and fought
Samira
before the Mist retreated.
