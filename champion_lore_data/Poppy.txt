Search for Purpose
[

Poppy's life had always been marked by a sense of longing for order, and alien to her was the chaotic and whimsical nature of the other Yordles in
Bandle City
. She felt disconnected from the typical Yordle lifestyle, driven instead by an unshakable desire to find her own purpose. Her journey brought her to the human lands of western
Valoran
, where she encountered numerous caravans of weary settlers seeking ephemeral hope and stability. But among the many, she saw those who possessed a purpose and were consistently and disciplined in their pursuit of it. Intrigued by their determination, Poppy saw in them something she could finally admire - people working together to create something greater than themselves, by their own hard work, not by
magic,
and that was marvellous to her.

Meeting Orlon

And among those people, one stood out, a human commander with a powerful, almost magnetic presence, leading his people by example. That man's name was Orlon. Watching him from afar, she saw how he was able to inspire the exhausted and chase away the doubts of the downhearted. He wielded a massive war hammer, but one that he swung with ease and skill. Fascinated by Orlon's leadership and feeling the closeness of souls for the first time, Poppy decided to introduce herself to him, risking her anonymity and introducing herself to humans for the first time. Although they both had many questions for each other and their introduction to each other was not easy, an unbreakable bond soon developed between them and Orlon became Poppy's mentor and guide. She accompanied him to the young kingdom of
Demacia
, a place where all who were willing to work for the common good were welcomed.

The Quest for the Hero

In time, Orlon became a beloved hero, admired throughout the fledgling kingdom. But the lives of men are brief, and as he lay on his deathbed, Orlon revealed to Poppy that his hammer had never truly belonged to him - it was meant for the Hero of Demacia, the one destined to protect the kingdom from its darkest threats. With a solemn vow to her dying friend, Poppy promised that she would one day find that hero and entrust him with the hammer.
And yet, for all her positive qualities, Poppy had always lacked ambition. It had never occurred to her that
she
might be the hero Orlon had spoken of.

A Hero's Calling

Poppy continued her search for Hero with unstoppable tenacity. Her quest had been going on for centuries, and more than once, she thought she had finally found the one worthy of wielding the hammer. Yet each attempt to pass it on ended in failure, often with the would-be hero meeting a tragic fate.
In one such attempt, she traveled to a remote corner of Demacia, where the deadly crag beasts had begun terrorizing the people. Great warriors from across the kingdom gathered to confront the creatures, and Poppy hoped one of them might be the Hero. Just as she arrived at the fortress, a colossal creature, towering like a mountain, launched its attack. Amid the chaos, a shining knight quickly organized a shelter for the civilians and then charged at the beast, his halberd at the ready. But his weapon shattered on impact.
Seeing his courage, Poppy handed him the hammer, and he struck again - but the blow had no effect. In one sweeping motion, the beast crushed the knight, and with his last breath, he surrendered. Another failure, another burden of guilt for Poppy. Yet, with the monster still a threat, she stepped forward, driven by her duty. In a fierce battle, she crushed the beast and protected the innocent. With her task complete, Poppy set off again, for her quest remained unfinished.

Poppy's
hammer
belonged to Demacia's founder and weaponsmith Orlon, who passed it on to her on his deathbed. She is searching for the 'Hero of Demacia' meant to wield the hammer (without realizing she is the one). When Orlon passed the hammer to Poppy, he did not specifically identify her as the Hero (or meant to, but died before he could), leading to Poppy's misunderstanding. Poppy and
Kled
are notable for being Yordles responsible for helping in building the human civilizations they align themselves with (Demacia and
Noxus
, respectively).
