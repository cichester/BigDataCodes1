The earliest known depictions of Rammus appear in ruins from the Shuriman Age of Ascension. Ancient mosaics and carvings show his likeness among demigods and revered spirits, often near temple gates or carved into the walls of inner sanctums. Scholars speculate he may have been seen as a harbinger of change or a guardian spirit of Shurima's shifting fate.
While most of Shurima was devastated or reshaped during the Rune Wars, stories say Rammus remained the same, rolling undisturbed through a dying world. To some, this was proof of divinity; to others, it marked him as a creature outside time itself.
Over the centuries, scattered accounts describe Rammus intervening in strange and often unexplained events. In one story, he entered the fortress of Siram—a labyrinth of magic and monsters—and within the hour, the entire structure collapsed into dust. Rammus was seen calmly rolling away.
During the Year of the Great Flood, he was reportedly seen crossing the newly-formed Lake Imalli in just two days, and later that year, destroyed a subterranean ant queen whose swarm had ruined farmland.
In recent memory, during a Noxian incursion near a forgotten Ascended temple, Rammus appeared without warning. His mere presence silenced the battlefield, and as he passed through, the tremors from his movement caused parts of the temple to collapse, burying the invaders beneath stone. Some called it divine justice. Others think he might have just been passing through.
A more personal tale comes from a boy named Ojan, the son of traders, who once carved a wooden figure of Rammus and prayed to it while his family's caravan was under attack by giant desert beetles.
Over time, these stories gave rise to cult-like devotion in parts of Shurima. Pilgrims speak of Rammus as a silent god who answers a single question to the truly desperate. Rituals in his name involve mass somersaulting, symbolic rolling, and offerings of honeycomb, ant colonies, or sweet goat’s milk, believed to be his favorite treats.
He' a being of few words. He doesn’t stay. But when he rolls past, something always changes.
