Background

Early Life

Childhood

Powder was born to
Felicia
and
Connol
, who worked as miners in the fissures of
Zaun
. She had an older sister named
Violet
, who was very protective of her and frequently reassured her that no "monster" would ever get her as long as she was around.
[

]
Several years after she was born, Powder and Vi were present along with their parents when
Vander
and
Silco
launched an uprising against
Piltover
across the Bridge of Progress in hopes of creating an independent Zaunite nation and securing a better life for their people. Upon encountering the
enforcers
waiting on them on the other side of the bridge, the situation turned violent and hundreds of Zaunites were massacred in the ensuing battle, including Vi and Powder's parents.
[

Knowing that her sister was too young to understand what was going on, Vi told Powder to cover her eyes and sing a song to herself to distract her from all the carnage around them. On the bridge, they ran into Vander, who recognized them due to his longtime friendship with their mother and realized that his failed uprising had left them both as orphans. Overcome with regret, Vander discarded his gauntlets, picked up the two girls in his arms, and carried them away to raise them as their father.
[

Powder grew up in a bar under Vander's care, where she became close with her adoptive brothers
Mylo
and
Claggor
, and gained a reputation for her innate talent in marksmanship and engineering.
[

]
She also became best friends with
Ekko
, who worked as an assistant for Vander's best friend
Benzo
, and often played a game with him in the street where she would try to shoot him with a paintball gun before he could tag her with a wooden sword.

The Robbery

Several years after they were adopted, Powder, who was now in her preteens, and Vi, who was now in her late teens, received a tip from Ekko on a wealthy Piltovan man that they could burglarize for some fast cash. Along with Mylo and Claggor, the four kids broke into the man's apartment and started collecting anything that looked valuable. While exploring the apartment, Powder eventually discovered a chest full of small blue crystals and took several of them out to take a look at them.
However, before she could examine them further, the
owner
of the apartment suddenly returned home and started banging on the door upon realizing that there were people inside. In the rush to flee the apartment with her siblings, Powder hastily shoved the crystals into her pocket and accidentally dropped one on the floor, which suddenly exploded after hitting a nearby wall. The subsequent explosion destroyed most of the building and alerted the Enforcers to their presence, forcing the four children to abandon their original escape plan and flee back to the undercity on foot, eventually escaping the Enforcers through a sewer tunnel.
While walking back home, the kids encountered
Deckard
and three other thugs, who demanded a share of the loot for themselves. When Vi refused to give them anything, the two gangs got into a fist fight. Although Vi, Mylo, and Claggor managed to defeat their opponents, Powder didn’t have an effective way to fight back against the thug who was chasing her, as her makeshift grenade failed to explode, and was forced to toss their loot into the river after he cornered her. Although Mylo was enraged that she lost the loot and accused her of “jinxing” their job by tagging along, Vi didn’t blame her sister for losing the loot and was simply relieved to find out that she wasn’t hurt. With nothing left to take back with them, the four children returned to the Lanes and made it back to the Last Drop, where they were scolded by Vander for disobeying his orders to stay away from Topside.
While Vander was lecturing Vi over her reckless behavior, Powder discovered that not all of their loot was lost and that she still had the crystals with her. She then rushed back to their common room to tell her sister about them, but decided against it when she found her arguing with Mylo over her role in their botched robbery. After Vi took her out later that night to console her, Powder finally revealed the crystals to her, with the two sisters eventually agreeing to keep it a secret between themselves.

The Fatal Rescue


Although the four children didn’t have any intention of causing more trouble, the Enforcers became increasingly aggressive in hunting them down over the next few weeks, which resulted in Powder nearly getting caught twice.
[

]
To protect his children from being arrested, Vander decided to turn himself in to the Enforcers, but before
Sheriff Grayson
and her subordinate
Marcus
could take him to Piltover, they were ambushed by Silco and Deckard, who killed Grayson and Benzo, and kidnapped Vander.
Having found out from Ekko where Silco had taken Vander, Vi resolved to rescue him with Mylo and Claggor’s help, and told Powder to stay behind at home for her own safety, handing her a blue flare to use if she needed her help. After her siblings left to go save Vander, Powder had a mental breakdown over being left behind and spent some time crying in her room until she discovered that the crystals she stole from Jayce’s apartment were responsible for causing the explosion that occurred during their heist. Believing that she could use them to help her family, Powder secretly traveled to the location of Silco’s hideout and observed the battle between Vi and Silco’s henchmen from afar. When Vi was overpowered by Deckard, Powder tried to save her by detonating the crystals through her homemade monkey bomb. Unfortunately, the explosion caused by the crystals turned out to be far more powerful than she anticipated and destroyed most of the building, killing Mylo and Claggor, and injuring Vander and Vi.
After Vi managed to escape the building seemingly at the expense of Vander’s life, Powder ran up to tell her that her monkey bomb had finally worked. However, after noticing Vander’s lifeless body and Claggor’s bloody goggles on the ground, Powder realized that her explosives had accidentally killed her entire foster family, causing her to break down in tears in horror and grief. Enraged that Powder had disobeyed her orders to stay behind, Vi punched her sister in the face, knocking her down to the ground, and angrily yelled at her that Mylo was right all along about her being a jinx. Powder continued to sob and apologize for her fatal mistake, and her reaction was enough for Vi to realize that she’d gone too far and walk away to cool herself down. Believing that Vi was leaving her, Powder pleaded with her to come back. When Vi didn’t return, having been arrested by Marcus before she could make her way back, Powder came to genuinely believe that her sister had abandoned her and had a mental breakdown in the middle of the street.
Shortly after Vi’s departure, Silco arrived on the scene with several of his henchmen and gently asked Powder, who was still crying in the middle of the street next to Vander’s body, where her sister was. To their surprise, Powder then jumped into Silco’s arms and told him that Vi had left her and was not her sister anymore. Realizing that Vi had betrayed her just like how Vander had betrayed him so many years ago, Silco moved to comfort her and decided to take her in under his care.
[

Becoming Jinx

Powder was haunted by the day she killed her foster family, and because of her perceived abandonment, she came to believe her own sister hated her. After some time, voices and vivid hallucinations of her loved ones began to torment her thoughts, blaming her for the death and destruction that had happened that day. In the pages of her diary, Powder scribbled numerous apologies, but the voices continued in a rambling, rhyming fashion, calling her "broken," "no good," and above all, a "jinx," which was the last thing Vi had said to her before she had disappeared. Since Vander, Claggor, and Mylo had all died together, Powder decided that she had died with them, abandoning her old name in favor of a new one:
"Jinx."
[

]
Jinx found comfort living with Silco, who had taken her under his wing and encouraged her to pursue her natural talents as an inventor and gunslinger. In a large abandoned duct over a set of old airship propellers, Jinx built a hidden, secret workshop decorated with mad paint scribbles and a pair of dolls fashioned to resemble Mylo and Claggor, where she could spend some time alone with the voices and her gadgetry. By fighting as one of Silco's henchman, she finally perfected her childhood bomb designs, making them far deadlier than before, which resulted in the creation of numerous homemade
chemtech
weapons like her
Chompers
, a minigun named
Pow-Pow
, and a rocket launcher called
Fishbones
. While initially afraid of Silco, Jinx came to sympathize with him, seeing him as "broken" just like she was, and their shared feelings of betrayal by their loved ones led them to form a close father-daughter bond.
[

]
Silco later told Jinx that her sister had died shortly after abandoning her, but despite this, Jinx continued to stubbornly hold onto the blue flare that Vi had given her all those years ago, even though she would probably never get to use it for its intended purpose.
[
9
]
Jinx eventually broke off her friendship with
Ekko
, who founded the
Firelights
and led the resistance against Silco's criminal empire, which was fueled by the production and distribution of
shimmer
. As a result, the two of them became bitter enemies by the time they were both in their late teens, with Ekko eventually accepting that "Powder" was dead.
[
6
]
As one of Silco's crew, Jinx developed a reputation for causing chaos and destruction on the missions that she participated in, and eventually came to be regarded as a loose cannon by Silco's henchmen, including his lieutenant
Sevika
. However, despite her decision to work for Silco, Jinx never became as committed as he was to his longtime dream of creating an independent Zaunite state and mainly followed his orders only because of the familial bond that they shared.
[

Piltovan Bicentennial

Bombing at the Academy Square

During another one of
Silco's
shimmer shipments, Jinx was tasked with protecting the cargo and stepped up to the job when the shipment was ambushed by the
Firelights
. While slaughtering the Firelights with her grenades, Jinx punched one of them hard enough to take her mask off and was surprised to see that the
girl
underneath resembled her sister
Vi
. This caused Jinx to suffer a traumatic attack and lose control, accidentally destroying most of the cargo herself in the process.
While
Sevika
was furious with Jinx for her blunder, Silco did not blame her for losing control and gave her a pass after Jinx told him her side of the story, telling her to take some time off to focus on her gadgetry. Feeling guilty for failing Silco, Jinx decided to make it up to him by stealing a
hextech
gemstone and several research papers from
Jayce
and
Viktor's
lab in Piltover. During the heist, she cooked up a trap with her
Chompers
to distract anyone who happened to be nearby, which killed six Enforcers and demolished an entire building. Although Silco was initially enraged to find out that Jinx had killed a bunch of Enforcers for seemingly no good reason and left him with even more of a mess to fix, he later approved of her actions when she showed him the gemstone and tasked her with weaponizing it so that it would put him in an even better position to demand
Zaun’s
independence from Piltover.
[

]
As Silco dealt with
Marcus
, who was furious over the deaths of his officers, Jinx got to work on reading Jayce and Viktor’s notes and used them to build her very own hextech device. However, upon activating it with the gemstone, the device released a powerful pulse of energy that resembled the explosion that killed her foster family, causing Jinx to suffer another traumatic attack and run away in tears. When Silco later reminded her that she needed to weaponize the gemstone as soon as possible, Jinx told him that she couldn’t do it and advised him to give it to the
doctor
instead.
Realizing that Jinx's trauma was getting in the way of her progress, Silco decided to take her out to the river where Vander nearly drowned him and told her how being betrayed by the man he considered to be his brother made him stronger than he ever was before. He advised Jinx to follow his example by letting Powder die and then baptized her in the water, encouraging her to let go of her past so that she could focus on fighting for Zaun's future. This proved to be enough for Jinx to get back on track and quickly perfect the device that she built from Jayce and Viktor’s notes, allowing her to clear the first step in weaponizing the gemstone on Silco’s behalf.
[

]

Sisterly Reunion


Not long after her trip with Silco to the river, Jinx learned from Sevika that
Vi
was still alive and had returned to Zaun to look for her. Believing that Silco had been lying to her about Vi’s fate ever since they first met, Jinx tied Sevika up and headed out to go find her sister herself. Remembering the blue flare that Vi had given her as a child, Jinx climbed onto the top of a building and lit it up in hopes that Vi would see it and come to her location, only for it to eventually burn out with her sister nowhere in sight. Just as Jinx was about to give up on waiting, Vi finally arrived on the platform and tearfully embraced her. Realizing that it was her sister in the flesh, Jinx dropped the hextech gemstone and hugged her back. Vi then apologized for leaving her and explained that she was arrested by an Enforcer before she could come back for her that day. Remembering all the pain that she suffered after Vi was taken from her, Jinx started crying as she told her sister that she had changed ever since the day she vanished from her life. However, Vi assured her that it was okay, as she had changed too, and told her that what really mattered was that they had found each other after all this time apart.
Unfortunately, it was at that moment that
Caitlyn
showed up, causing Jinx to let go of Vi and realize that Sevika hadn’t been lying to her about her sister working with an Enforcer. Although Vi attempted to calm Jinx down, all that did was cause Jinx to become paranoid and mistrustful of her sister, believing that she was playing some kind of cruel trick on her and manipulating her emotions in order to steal the gemstone back. However, Vi remained insistent that she only came here to make amends with Jinx for leaving her as a child and made it clear that no matter what happened, she was not going to abandon her sister again.
Before Jinx had the chance to respond to Vi, they were suddenly ambushed by the Firelights. Although the two sisters put up a good fight, the Firelights eventually overwhelmed them with their superior numbers and managed to kidnap both Vi and Caitlyn, steal the gemstone from Jinx, and flee the scene under the cover of their smoke grenades. After the smoke cleared, Jinx realized that she was all alone without the gemstone and had lost her sister again, causing her to scream in anguish.
[
11
]
Upon returning to her lair, Jinx was plagued by her hallucinations, causing her to become jealous of Caitlyn and obsessively reassure herself that Vi came back for her and not for the gemstone. Still livid with Silco for lying to her about Vi’s death, Jinx later confronted him in his office and angrily stabbed him several times with his eye injection syringe. This led Silco to hastily reveal to her that Marcus was the one who originally lied to him and that any secrets that he'd kept from her were simply to protect her from further harm. When Jinx wasn’t convinced by these words, Silco reminded her how he was the one who gave her a home after her sister’s disappearance. He also emphasized the importance of weaponizing the gemstone and told her that he needed her more than ever to make it happen, which was enough to convince Jinx to listen to him, give him a proper injection, and storm out of the room in tears.
[

]

Battle on the Bridge

Knowing that Caitlyn and Vi would eventually travel back to Piltover to return the gemstone, Jinx caught them crossing the Bridge of Progress at night with
Ekko
serving as their escort, and noticed that Vi and Caitlyn had a romantic interest in each other. This caused her hallucinations to flare up even after Vi parted ways with Caitlyn and started heading back to Zaun to look for her. When Marcus, who was guarding the bridge along with a squad of Enforcers, shot Ekko in the chest, Vi turned around out of concern for Caitlyn’s safety. Consumed by a jealous fit of rage, Jinx then unleashed her mechanical firelight bombs, killing everyone on the bridge except for Vi, Ekko, and Caitlyn.
Pleased with the carnage that she’d caused, Jinx casually strolled across the bridge and picked up the canister that Ekko had used to hold the gemstone. However, right after hoisting the canister onto her shoulder, she discovered Vi helping Caitlyn to her feet and attacked them with Pow-Pow when her hallucinations started up again, which distorted Caitlyn’s face and made her look evil. Before Jinx could kill Caitlyn, Ekko suddenly appeared on his hoverboard, having survived Marcus’ shot to his chest due to the metal plate hidden under his clothes. He then knocked Pow-Pow out of Jinx's hands, stole back the canister, and tossed it to Vi and Caitlyn, telling them to go while he covered their escape.
As Jinx moved to attack with her pistol, Ekko remembered the paintball game they used to play as kids and used it to accurately predict where she would fire, enabling him to dodge all of her shots and attack her at close range. He then brutally beat her with his bat and pinned her down on the ground, but as he moved to kill her, he noticed the frightened look on her face, which reminded him of the girl that he used to know and caused him to hesitate. That sentimentality distracted Ekko long enough for Jinx to take out one of her Chompers and detonate it right next to them, critically injuring herself in the process.
[

The Shimmer Procedure

Although Ekko survived the grenade blast with only moderate injuries, he didn't try to help Jinx and spent several moments staring at her lifeless body in dismay before fleeing the scene. Shortly after his departure, Silco arrived on the bridge and immediately rushed to check on Jinx after noticing her lying unconscious in the middle of the bridge. After verifying that she was still alive and noticing she had recovered the gemstone from Ekko’s canister, Silco picked up Jinx in his arms and carried her to
Singed's
lab to get her treatment. Although Singed was initially hesitant to heal Jinx due to the fact that her wounds were almost fatal, he eventually complied on Silco’s insistence and then knocked him out with a chemical injection so that he wouldn’t interfere with the operation.
With Silco out of the way, Singed subjected Jinx to an experimental surgical procedure to save her life and injected her with shimmer so that her body could heal from the damage she'd inflicted upon herself. At one point during the surgery, Jinx woke up, her body wracked with extreme pain, and had a vivid hallucination of Vi betraying her and replacing her with Caitlyn. As Singed injected her again with a sadistic smile on his face, he remarked that the pain was only going to get worse, causing Jinx to scream in agony before blacking out again. Despite all the pain that Singed put her through to save her life, Jinx ultimately survived the surgery and left Singed's lab before Silco came to.
[

The Tea Party


After being healed by Singed, Jinx broke into Caitlyn’s house in Piltover and kidnapped her while she was in the middle of taking a shower. She also kidnapped Silco after he returned from his meeting with Jayce, having come to the misconception that he was planning on betraying her to the Topsiders for his dream of independence, and then kidnapped Vi after she defeated Sevika in the Last Drop. The three of them later woke up to find out that Jinx had tied them all up and brought them to Silco’s old shimmer factory to have to have a tea party of sorts, which included her wooden dolls of Mylo and Claggor, along with several of Vander and Vi’s old belongings.
After lighting up the candles on the table, Jinx revealed to Vi that she had set up two chairs, one labeled
"Powder"
and the other labeled
"Jinx"
, and told her that it was her decision to make on which chair she would sit in. She then handed her pistol to Vi and told her if she used it to kill Caitlyn, she could “have Powder back.” When Vi refused, Jinx picked up the gun and moved to kill Caitlyn herself, but stopped when Vi frantically pleaded with her sister to run away with her and leave all of this behind. When Silco attempted to speak, Jinx removed his gag, prompting him to furiously accuse Vi of lying to her sister. He then promised Jinx that he never intended to sell her out to Piltover, as he regarded her as his daughter and preferred to burn Topside to the ground than to hand her over to them.
Silco’s words moved Jinx emotionally, but before he could convince her to untie him, Caitlyn broke free from her restraints, having cut her ropes with a stray piece of glass, and threatened to kill Jinx with Pow-Pow if she didn’t drop her pistol first. After putting the gun down on the table and feigning surrender, Jinx then charged at Caitlyn with
inhuman speed
and punched her in the face before she could react in time to defend herself, knocking her out cold and taking back Pow-Pow from her hands. Silco then told Jinx to finish Caitlyn off, but before she could move in for the kill, Vi pleaded with Jinx to remember their late loved ones in the hopes that she would spare Caitlyn and revert back to her old self as Powder. This caused Jinx to suffer a mental breakdown and have twisted, monstrous hallucinations of Mylo, Claggor, Vander, and her late parents. Realizing that Vi was hurting Jinx, Silco managed to wrestle one arm free of his restraints, grab Jinx's pistol, and aim it at Vi. Unfortunately, the sound of her pistol being cocked was enough to set Jinx off and caused her to start firing wildly with Pow-Pow, punching several holes through Vi's chair and accidentally shooting Silco in the chest.
Horrified by what she’d done, Jinx ran over to Silco, cupped his face in her hands, and started crying upon realizing that he was beyond saving. However, despite the fact that he was dying, Silco did not blame her for causing his impending death and softly reassured her that he never would have traded her to the Topsiders for anything. He then tried to comfort her, telling her not to cry and that she was perfect the way she was, shortly before his heart gave out and he died in her arms. Realizing that Silco was gone for good, Jinx continued to sob quietly before suddenly becoming stoic when Vi told that everything was okay and that she was still open to running away together like old times. However, instead of listening to her sister, Jinx effectively abandoned her old identity as Powder by sitting down in the chair labeled “Jinx” and bitterly told Vi that due to how much both of them had changed in their years apart, they would never be able to love each other like they used to.
With no need to deal with Vi and Caitlyn now that Silco was dead, Jinx picked up the gemstone and headed out to the edge of the harbor, where it was revealed that she had weaponized the gemstone through
Fishbones
, her signature rocket launcher. With tears still streaming down her cheeks, Jinx then fired Fishbones at Piltover’s council building in honor of Silco’s memory, destroying the upper half of the building and killing nearly half of the councilors inside, including
Hoskel
,
Bolbok
, and Caitlyn’s mother
Cassandra
.

Piltover's Most Wanted

Jinx held a private funeral for Silco at the spot where Vander had nearly drowned him, releasing his body into the depths as her hallucinations finally ceased. Afterwards, she roamed the streets of Zaun, watching as his empire splintered between his
chembaron
lieutenants, who all sought to claim Silco's chair for themselves.
[
13
]
Following her attack on the Council, Jinx had become the most wanted criminal across all of Piltover, and was sometimes caught in the crossfire of the gang violence. During this time she befriended
Isha
, a young orphan whom she saved from
Chross'
chem-goons and later took an interest in Jinx's gadgets, beginning to follow her around. Jinx also managed to mend her relationship with Sevika, as they both felt a angry and confused after Silco's death. Since Sevika had lost her arm, Jinx left to build her a new one out of scraps.
Though Jinx was able to finish Sevika's arm, she quickly encountered Caitlyn's strike team, who were weaponizing with the Gray — a toxic industrial smog that accumulated in the vent that the
Kirammans
built centuries ago to contain it — against the undercity. Jinx became distraught as she realized that Vi was among the Enforcers, and managed to escape, crying at her sister's betrayal. She was soon caught by the chembaron
Smeech
, who was planning to hand her over to Piltover in return for her bounty. Jinx was rescued by Sevika, who made use of the new arm and killed Smeech and his henchmen, and the two of them made a plan to entrap Caitlyn and Vi to "finish" what was left of Jinx's family.
[
13
]
Jinx set her trap in
Janna's
temple, which she decorated with graffiti murals depicting her life with Vi. She tricked Caitlyn into revealing her position with a series of mirror tricks while taunting them, sending Sevika to attack Caitlyn as she engaged Vi herself, exchanging harsh words before trying to kill each other. Jinx lost the fight and had most of her weapons destroyed, as well as losing a finger to Caitlyn's rifle. However, when Jinx asked Vi to finish her off, Isha intervened, putting herself in the way of Vi's gauntlets and Caitlyn's rifle. Before Caitlyn could kill both Jinx and Isha, Sevika activated a bomb Jinx had set up that blew up the temple, saving their lives and sending the Gray in an explosive, colorful display that painted the entirety of topside.
[
14
]
This attack, combined with her earlier destruction of the Piltover Council, inspired people across the undercity to adopt Jinx's colors, painting a mural in her honor and viewing her as a symbol of resistance against topside, and they became known as the "Jinxers."

Martial Law Period

Life in Hiding

Believing she should have died in the explosive finale she had set up, Jinx went into hiding in her lair, taking
Isha
with her and declaring "Jinx is dead." Despite Jinx's disinterest in being a symbol.
Sevika
and Isha regularly encouraged Jinx to come out of hiding so she could finally unite the undercity. With Jinx believing herself incapable of being a hero, Isha secretly impersonated her, using her gadgets to inspire
Zaunites
in acts of resistance against the
Piltovan
and
Noxian
forces, who had been cracking down on them hard under martial law for months. Isha's reckless actions would eventually lead to her getting captured, and after learning about this from Sevika, the two of them left for Stillwater Hold to rescue her, with Jinx arming herself with a new hextech shock pistol called
Zapper
, which she had upgraded from her old gun. Jinx was able to sneak inside by disguising herself as an Enforcer and eventually freed all the undercity folk, declaring herself their "big fat hero." The people, among them many Jinxers and
Firelights
, all approached and silently thanked her. Jinx then went to find Isha.
[
15
]
Though Jinx had successfully rescued everyone, their respite was short-lived, as
Warwick
, a chemtech beast who had been summoned there by his creator,
Singed
, began his rampage through the hallway. After directing Sevika to take Isha to safety, Jinx lost the battle and waited to be killed by Warwick. However, the beast seemingly recognized her as "Powder" as he looked into her eyes, and Jinx suddenly realized in disbelief that he was speaking to her in Vander's voice. Warwick suddenly fled from the prison and Jinx gave chase, but ended up losing track of him in the mines.
[
16
]

Saving Vander

Jinx sought the help of
Vi
, who had been reduced to a drunken brawler in a fighting ring after being dumped by Caitlyn. Jinx attempted to reconcile with Vi, but encountered some difficulty due to the fact they'd tried to kill each other in their last meeting. Though Jinx informed her that Vander was alive, Vi believed she was either lying or hallucinating as usual, but reluctantly decided to help her. Jinx and Isha led Vi into the mines, where the sisters got into a fight and Isha got a nosebleed, setting Warwick on their trail. Later on, Jinx and Vi found the old home of Vander and Silco, where they learned more about their past as miners and found an old note Vander had left, describing his regrets at having nearly killed Silco all those years ago. Jinx wondered if things could have ended differently if Silco had only found the note. When they returned outside Warwick attacked them, driven mad by the scent of blood. Jinx pleaded with Vi not to hurt Warwick, and when she eventually listened they managed to reawaken Vander's old memories, bringing the man out from within the beast. Vi hugged her father and invited Jinx to join them, and their family experienced a tearful reunion.
[
16
]
Though they had recovered some of their father's memories, Vander's mind was still twisted and tortured by Singed's experiments, and Jinx and Vi began looking for a way to bring him back fully. They received word of a magic healer who could work miracles and brought him to
Viktor
, who agreed to help them. While Jinx didn't seem to believe Viktor's efforts would work, the
commune
had been built near the ruins of her childhood home, and she and Vi both wondered if they could all build a new life there. This would not last, however, as
Ambessa's
army soon marched on the commune, and Jinx and Isha prepared to defend Warwick from being captured by Singed and Caitlyn. Caitlyn suddenly betrayed Singed, and Jinx went to defend her against
Rictus
, Ambessa's right-hand man. Though Rictus defeated Jinx, Vander stepped in and saved her, and she and Vi were both overjoyed to have him back. A few seconds later, however, all the cultists in Viktor's commune suddenly collapsed, and Warwick flew into another rage, killing Rictus and sparking a full-scale battle against Ambessa's forces.
[
17
]
Jinx attempted to reason with Warwick, but he attacked her violently, and to save Jinx's life Isha overloaded her Zapper with three hextech gemstones, sacrificing herself in a massive explosion. Grieving the loss of both Isha and Vander, Jinx rushed an injured Vi to safety before turning herself in to the authorities.

Breaking the Cycle

After turning herself in, Jinx had seemingly lost any will to live, apologizing to Caitlyn for killing her mother before asking to be executed. Her hallucinations returned after losing Isha, and she spoke with the voice of Silco, who explained to her the cycles of vengeance that drove him and Vander to suffering, in their conversation Jinx realized that the only way to end the cycle was to "walk away." Later, when Vi had recovered, she attempted to free Jinx, declaring that she could use her powers for good and "rewrite" her story. Realizing her sister would never give up on her, Jinx sucker-punched Vi and locked her in the cell, declaring that Vi needed to forget about her and go live a happy life with Caitlyn. When Vi asked what Jinx was planning to do, she simply said she would "break the cycle."
[
18
]
After cutting off her hair and setting fire to the Last Drop, Jinx attempted to end her own life in her lair using a newly-constructed hextech monkey bomb. However, she was stopped by
Ekko
, who told her that despite her mistakes, it was never too late for her to build something new.
[
19
]
In the lead-up to Ambessa's invasion of Piltover, Jinx joined Ekko and went to the Firelight hideout, where she combined all her old weapons into a new device that she called
"Rhino"
.
[
2
]
She also engineered the propellers of her lair into a painted war balloon and led the charge of the undercity people, including Ekko and Sevika, to aid in the final battle against Ambessa and
Viktor
, rescuing Vi and Caitlyn from certain defeat.
Though Jinx's attack had turned the tide, Warwick, who had been transformed into one of Viktor's mindless puppets, arrived with Viktor's drones and attacked Vi and eventually Jinx and Ekko as well, crashing her airship into the tower. After a reconciliation between the sisters, Jinx and Vi fought Warwick within the Hexgate and were eventually caught in the
storm
from Viktor's Anomaly, which threatened to absorb them into the Herald's hivemind. Jayce and Ekko were able to defeat Viktor, finally releasing them from the gravity field, but leaving Vi trapped on a precarious ledge. Jinx begged Vi to jump to safety, but she was too injured and distraught to move as Warwick awoke in a mindless, savage state. Realizing Vi was unable to let Vander go, Jinx chose to sacrifice herself, hurling both herself and Warwick down the tower shaft while hugging him one last time. After this, Jinx activated her monkey bomb, seemingly killing them both.
Jinx was presumed dead after the explosion, and she was mourned by a grieving Vi, Ekko, and presumably the other Jinxers and Firelights. However, Caitlyn would run an investigation of the Hexgate schematics and the destroyed remains of Jinx's monkey bomb, suggesting that Jinx's body had never been found after the explosion, and that Caitlyn suspected Jinx could have faked her death by escaping through a ventilation shaft. As Caitlyn pondered this evidence and spoke with Vi, an airship resembling the one Powder had promised to fly on one day soared over the sea and into the distance, toward an unknown destination.

Appearance

Jinx is a slender and short teenage girl with a narrow build and sinewy arms and legs. She has blue, ankle-length hair that she wears in two thick braids that fall over her mid-back and cascade to her ankles, with a chin-length swoop of hair on the right side of her face. She is normally seen wearing a black sleeveless leather crop top with a leather choker, purple striped trousers often complemented by dark leather accessories with purple accents on her arms, black leather ankle-length boots with purple laces, and a worn crisscross band-aid on her left knee. She also has long nails that are painted blue and pink, and light blue cloud tattoos on her right arm, shoulder, and midriff. While her eyes were originally a blue-grey color, her appearance would change after receiving an experimental
shimmer
procedure from
Singed
, where her skin became extremely pale and her eyes changed color to bright pink, with purple vein-like patterns around them. After her next battle with
Caitlyn
, Jinx lost her left middle finger and replaced it with a mechanical brass-colored prosthetic, with a painted pink smiley face to replace the fingernail.
As a child, Powder had greyish eyes and shoulder-length hair tied back into a single braid with hastily cut bangs accented with intricate silver clips. She normally wore a short-sleeved blue top over a striped pink undershirt, black arm warmers, short brown pants, long lilac socks, and simple brown shoes.

Personality

As a child, Powder was a kind, curious, and creative girl with a reckless streak that led her to often make decisions that negatively affected the people around her. This led Mylo to frequently criticize her for her incompetence and eventually caused Powder to develop an inferiority complex along with a strong desire to prove her worth to her foster siblings and her sister
Vi
in particular. She also suffered from attachment issues due to losing her parents as a toddler and had a problem with following orders, which was part of the reason why she didn’t listen to Vi’s instructions to stay behind during their mission to rescue Vander from Silco.
After accidentally killing her foster family and being seemingly abandoned by Vi at her weakest moment, Jinx’s trauma became extremely pronounced and caused her to suffer from intense hallucinations of Mylo, Claggor, and Vi in the years after she was taken in by Silco. It also stunted her emotional growth, leaving her with childish tendencies even in her late teens, and prompted her to adopt a bubbly and energetic facade to mask all the pain and guilt that she kept beneath the surface. Over time, her unhealed trauma transformed Jinx into a chaotic and excitable individual who relished death and destruction, and had little remorse for the people that she killed along the way. Her wild behavior earned her a reputation as a loose cannon among the members of Silco’s crew and eventually got to the point where even Silco himself had no way to keep her under control. Her mental instability also caused her to exhibit a sarcastic, sassy, and dark-humored demeanor towards her enemies or people she didn’t fully trust, as seen when she pranked Vi into thinking that she was going to serve her Caitlyn’s head on a platter.
Despite her radical change in personality after accidentally murdering her foster family, Jinx never lost the desire for approval that she had a child and simply transferred it from Vi to Silco after her sister’s disappearance. She was also later revealed to have a very twisted and possessive attitude towards Vi, and was extremely fearful of losing her all over again. As a result, when Vi eventually returned to the undercity to find her, Jinx did everything in her power to make sure that Vi didn’t leave her again and even resorted to kidnapping her and Caitlyn to ensure that didn't happen, only to ultimately let her sister go and reject her old identity as Powder after finally coming to the bitter realization that they would never be able to love each other like they used to.
Throughout the series, Jinx displays a deep and complex transformation, shaped by loss, loyalty, and identity, accompanied by psychological trauma.

The first signs of hallucinations appear as a child on the bridge, when her parents died. As an adult, after the trauma of Vi's departure, the hallucinations become more pronounced. However, the hallucinations do not depend on whether the person is dead or how long she has been dead, or whether the person associated with the hallucinations is alive (example: Vi and Cait are alive, but appear in Jinx's hallucinations on the operating table. Mylo and Claggor are long dead, but still appear in hallucinations). She also hallucinates people who have not done anything bad to her (example: Vander and Isha. Isha hallutiantion sitting at her feet in Season 2, Episode 4, but that at this point she has not done anything bad to Jinx, and she is alive). Jinx's hallucinations range from the grotesque, to the humanoid, to childish scribbles.
Things that are related to important people, kept for a long time and usually used to communicate with them. For example, Jinx made a Mylo and Claggor doll. She argues with the Mylo doll during dinner. She keeps Vander's box, Violet's stuffed rabbit, and also approaches Silco's chair in an attempt to talk to him when she is afraid of losing Isha.
Repeated contacts, reconciliation and forgiveness, willingness to listen. During the series, Jinx has repeatedly shown that she is ready to make repeated contact with people important to her and to do it first, as well as a willingness to listen, even if the person had previously hidden information. So in the case of Vi, Jinx during the first season several times independently tries to make repeated contacts, and also comes to her in the second season, under the pretext of saving Vander.Jinx has caught Silco more than once on the fact that he is not finishing speaking, but still remains close, and even at dinner she takes out his gag herself, ready to listen to his opinion.Jinx, despite all her aggression and paranoia, is ready to forgive people and try to reconcile. So in the case of the same Vi, Vander became the reason for reconciliation, although earlier the sister was ready to catch and even kill her. Jinx was also able to find a common language with Sevika, against the backdrop of Silco's death, and even made her a new arm with drawings in her signature style.
Long-term and intense regret for loss and/or guilt. Throughout the series, it is evident that Jinx feels regret for those important to her people who suffered because of her or for her. Thus, the images of Mylo, Claggor, and Vander linger in her mind for a long time. With the death of Silco and the appearance of Isha, this weakens but does not go away. So she herself comes to Silco's chair in an attempt to talk to him, and Mylo and Claggor return as hallucinations. Isha's death even leads to suicidal actions.

Abilities

Chemically Altered Physiology:
Due to being subjected to an experimental surgery by
Singed
that used an advanced version of
shimmer
to save her life, Jinx was permanently altered by the drug's effects, giving her superhuman physical abilities in exchange for an even more deteriorated mental state.
Enhanced Strength:
Jinx is substantially stronger than the average human. Despite her slender build, she was strong enough to knock
Caitlyn
out with one punch and lift
Vi's
deactivated
Atlas Gauntlets
almost effortlessly, a notable feat given that Vi could barely lift even one deactivated gauntlet on her own. She was also strong enough to toss Fishbones, a rocket launcher almost as long as she is tall, into the air as if it were a basketball and easily jump high enough to catch it in mid-air so that she could use it to take a shot at Vi during their temple fight.
Enhanced Speed:
Jinx can move at incredible speeds, as displayed by how she was able to disarm Caitlyn in a split second and knock her out before the latter could react in time to defend herself. She was also able to dodge and parry many of
Warwick's
attacks during their confrontation in Stillwater and could move so fast that even he had trouble keeping up with her speed during certain points of their fight.
Enhanced Durability:
Jinx is far more durable than the average human. She was able to tank numerous punches from Vi's Atlas Gauntlets, which are strong enough to easily shatter ribs, without suffering any broken bones and withstand several of Warwick's attacks while only sustaining moderate injuries, a notable feat given that Warwick can easily eviscerate people with his claws.
Enhanced Endurance:
Jinx has an inhumanly high tolerance to pain. Despite all the punches that Vi landed on her during their temple fight, she was able to keep moving and fighting back against her older sister with little trouble. She was also able to withstand the pain of getting her middle finger shot off her left hand, with the injury only slowing her down by several seconds, and inhale large amounts of the Gray for a prolonged period of time without passing out or suffocating.
Inventor:
Despite not having any formal education, Jinx is a prolific engineer and inventor, having created numerous contraptions and weapons with her own creativity and ingenuity. She was also able to quickly reverse-engineer the
hextech
technology originally created by
Jayce
and
Viktor
with just the aid of their research journal, making her the first
Zaunite
to build hextech weapons for her own use.
Pow-Pow
:
A minigun of her own design, this served as Jinx's primary weapon during her usual escapades around
Piltover
and Zaun.
Fishbones
:
Designed from her childhood drawings, this rocket launcher has a
chemtech
payload known as
Super Mega Rockets
. At one point, this weapon was modified to use a hextech gemstone as its power source, enabling it to shoot its payload over longer distances with greater power.
Rhino
:
An all-terrain heavy weapon that functions as both a machine gun and a rocket launcher, it was created when Jinx fused the remains of Pow-Pow, Fishbones, and her Zapper with with a power source from
Heimerdinger's
H-28G Evolution Turret
, a cooling system from
Ekko's
hoverboard, and a heating pipe from the
Firelights
' hideout.
[
20
]
Gun
:
A pistol that fires chemtech bullets and is easily capable of injuring any targeted person. Jinx later renamed this weapon as her
Zapper
and modified it to use a hextech gemstone as its power source, enabling it to fire blasts of arcane energy at her targets.
Chompers
:
Inspired by her childhood bomb designs, these grenades have a chemtech payload inside them. Disarming one can prove to be very dangerous, as its inner mechanisms are difficult to go through due to their random scrapheap design, even for highly skilled engineers such as Viktor and Jayce.
Monkey Bomb
:
A clockwork toy monkey filled with several explosive hex crystals, it was the first working bomb that Jinx ever created.

Expert Markswoman:
Jinx is a natural with a gun and could accurately shoot at moving targets from a very young age. As she grew into her teens, she refined her shooting skills even further, making her one of the deadliest fighters in the undercity.
Brawler:
Although not as skilled as Vi, Jinx is competent at hand-to-hand combat, as displayed by how she was able to hold her own against her older sister during their fight in the temple.

Relations

Vi


Violet was Powder's older sister, and they were close growing up together under
Vander's
care. The two of them had lost their parents at a very young age, so Vi took it upon herself to be her sister's protector. Vi was very encouraging of Powder, defending her often against their adoptive brother Mylo's teasing and always being her biggest supporter, and they often sat together looking at the devices Powder had invented on her own. After Vander was kidnapped, Vi told her sister to stay behind so she wouldn't get hurt. Powder misunderstood Vi's intentions, however, and assumed Vi did not believe in her abilities, which led to a mental breakdown. In an effort to prove herself, Powder took the hex crystals she stole, went to the cannery, and built a bomb, accidentally killing their entire family. The disaster led to Vi smacking Powder in the face and calling her a 'jinx' before storming away to cool herself off. Although Vi always intended to return to Powder, she was arrested by
Marcus
, and as a result of this Powder believed she was abandoned. Jinx would later claim that Vi was what motivated her to become stronger, and she would come to believe that Vi was the one truly responsible for creating "Jinx."
When she was an adult, Vi returned to the undercity in search of her sister, only to find "Jinx" in her place, who was the loyal henchman and daughter of
Silco
. Powder's transformation deeply disturbed and troubled Vi; and Vi's new and intimate relationship with
Caitlyn
upset Jinx. Although Jinx missed her sister, Vi's sudden return from the "dead" left her conflicted and confused, as Vi still claimed to love her, but she also feared that Vi hadn't truly returned for her and was simply manipulating her to try and gain Caitlyn's favor—a notion that was exacerbated by Silco and
Sevika
. Silco had in turn falsely led Jinx to believe Vi had been dead for years, and the trauma of Jinx's perceived abandonment ran deep, making her became increasingly paranoid and violent in Vi's presence. Ultimately, their reunion was short-lived, and after a few more separations and misunderstandings, Jinx eventually kidnapped Vi, Caitlyn, and Silco to attend a tea party so she could resolve her identity crisis. Jinx accidentally shot Silco while protecting her sister, after which she abandoned "Powder" completely and fully embraced her identity as "Jinx," claiming that their bond had been irreparably changed. Later, Jinx was horrified to learn that Vi had joined the
Piltover Enforcers
—the very people who had killed their parents—just to pursue her into Zaun. Believing that Vi would never forgive her, Jinx engineered one final trap in the temple, which was intended to result in her own death at Vi's hands. Jinx's plan failed, in large part because Jinx and Vi still loved each other, despite feeling unable to reconcile.
When Jinx and Vi met again, Jinx had discovered Vander in the form of
Warwick
, and since some time had passed she once again sought help from her older sister, believing it had been a mistake for them to try and save him alone the last time. While their relationship was still rocky, they were eventually able to forgive each other when they managed to bring back Vander's memories. However, Jinx's past trauma was still very much alive, and the moment they lost Vander again Jinx decided she was unworthy of Vi's love, attempting to cut herself out of her life again as a means to protect her.
In the final battle against the Noxians, Jinx was eventually convinced she could use her inventions for good and returned to save Vi's life, despite all the pain she deemed herself responsible for in the past. During the battle, she declared that no matter what she was always with Vi, even when they were "worlds apart." After the battle, Vi cried in anguish as Jinx activated her bomb, as she seemingly sacrificed herself to save her sister's life.

Felicia


Felicia was
Violet
and Powder's mother, and she was a miner and strong believer in the nation of
Zaun
so that she could create a better life for her children. On some days, she would come home and make soup for Powder and marked her and Vi's heights on the wall of their tiny house in the Fissures. Felicia's close friends,
Vander
and
Silco
, both shared her dream for the whole of the undercity, but this would unfortunately lead to Felicia's death in the Day of Ash, where a mass protest by Zaunites turned into a massacre by the
Piltover Enforcers
, and Felicia and her husband
Connol
were among the many people killed. As she was still very young, Powder was frightened by the violence but did not fully comprehend the severity of what had happened, but was able to recognize the Vi's sadness when she saw their parents' bodies and moved to comfort her.
After she grew up, Jinx remembered very little about her mother, besides the fact that she had been murdered by Enforcers (a fact which informed her disgust towards
Topside
and led her to view
Vi
as a traitor for joining them). After Silco's death, Jinx searched a safe in his office and found a photo of him with Felicia and Vander. Jinx barely recognized her mother, but knew it was her due to the striking resemblance between herself and the woman in the image. Jinx also knew of Felicia's favorite song
Our Love
, which was a song she and Vander used to dance to together in The Last Drop.

Warwick

After his uprising led to the deaths of her parents,
Vander
took in Powder and her sister
Violet
as his own children. He would teach them to live a better life, guiding Powder to be a better person than himself. However, being guilted by her own actions that caused Vander's death, she would regress into her own childhood memories, trying to avoid the trauma of what had happened. The images of Vander would come and haunt her, bringing her much pain whenever they surface. After several years of blaming herself for Vander's death, Jinx would unexpectedly find him again within Warwick, the chemtech beast that attacked her in Stillwater Hold. While his memories only occurred in flashes, Jinx was determined to bring her father back, possibly as a way to make up for her tragic mistake all those years ago. She risked her life many times trying to calm him down and even mended her relationship with Vi in order to save him. When Vander's mind was eventually saved and their family was reunited, Jinx wept tears of joy as she hugged them both.
Unfortunately, Jinx's efforts to save Vander were undone by
Viktor
,
Ambessa
, and
Singed
, who later recaptured Warwick and erased his memories once again, before using him as a weapon against Jinx and Vi. Jinx seemed reluctant to fight her father, but seemed to recognize that he was gone and could not be saved. Jinx managed to finally defeat Warwick while hugging him one last time before activating her monkey bomb, and they seemingly perished in the explosion together.

Silco


After her monkey bomb killed her family, as well as her perceived abandonment by
Vi
, Powder was orphaned once again and all alone, sobbing in the rain. She turned to the first person who was there to seek comfort, which turned out to be Silco. To the surprise of Silco's henchmen, he comforted the young girl after learning she had been "betrayed" by her sibling, as he had been by
Vander
all those years ago in the polluted waters of
Zaun
. Silco declared that they would both get their revenge one day, and he took her under his wing as his own child.
Silco became the most powerful
chembaron
in Zaun, and Jinx was Silco's precious adopted daughter and most trusted agent. He covered up her messes, and never punished nor blamed her—only rarely remonstrating her when she got way out of hand. He loved her as his own even when other agents disliked her and her tactics. Silco entrusted Jinx to administer his shimmer injections to his disfigured eye and to carry out his most important schemes. Jinx was so dear to Silco that when he found her left for dead on the bridge after the battle between Jinx and
Ekko
, he rushed to her to check on her condition and then save her life, despite the danger of being captured by approaching reinforcements from Piltover, and ignoring his high status among his subordinates who came with him on the bridge. Jinx in turn, sought to become formidable to gain his approval and trusted him until she overheard that he may sell her out to the Piltover Council in order to gain Zaun's independence. When she later accidentally killed Silco to save Vi, he still comforted her in his dying moments and told her that he wouldn't give her up for anything, as she realized what she had done. She later held a private funeral for Silco, releasing him into the depths where Vander had tried to drown him, which had given birth to his cunning and ruthlessness.
Jinx eventually found a note from Vander intended for Silco, in which he apologized for trying to drown him. After reading it, Jinx regretted that Silco had never seen it, as it might have allowed things to turn out differently. When Jinx turned herself in to the Piltovan authorities, she spoke with a hallucination of Silco in her cell as they lamented the tragic cycle of violence that had doomed them both. Silco's voice convinced Jinx to "break the cycle," which she could only accomplish by finding the strength to walk away from the conflict.

Ekko


Ekko and Powder were childhood best friends, as they were similar age and had similar interests,
[
21
]
like tinkering with their custom-made inventions. They used to play a paintball game together where he would attempt and fail to dodge her shots. After Powder was adopted by
Silco
and became Jinx, Ekko led the resistance against his criminal empire by founding the
Firelights
, and having landed on opposite sides of the conflict, she and Ekko became bitter enemies. When Ekko and the Firelights established their base, they painted a mural of all the people they had lost, which included Powder, signifying that Ekko believed his childhood friend was gone forever. Jinx was responsible for the deaths of many of Ekko's friends, She killed at least five of Ekko's Firelights in one battle alone, and, as her very presence was known to cause fear in their ranks, it is implied she was responsible for many more. At their battle on the bridge, Ekko likened it to the paintball game they used to play in their childhood, and used the vivid memory to accurately predict where Jinx would shoot. Although Ekko usually lost those games when they were children, he defeated Jinx in a real battle and was ready to land the final blow before seeing Jinx's face, which reminded him of the Powder he used to know. That sentimentality distracted him, and she ended up detonating a bomb, injuring Ekko and gravely injuring herself.
Ekko was a part of Jinx's past, significant enough to remember. She agreed to repeat the game as a child, during the duel on the bridge. And she remembered how he looked at her then on the bridge. However, this did not stop her from shooting at him, and detonating grenades next to him when he was nearby, that is, causing possible damage. Also, unlike Vi, Silco and Isha, she did not look for a reason to make peace as she did with Vi and Silco, did not make contact first, did not mourn Ekko like the same Silco and Isha, and did not even try to find out if he survived on the bridge. He did not appear among her hallucinations and things related to people important to her, as it was with Mylo, Claggor, Vander, Silco, Vi and Isha (Isha's hallucination appears once in episode 4 of season 2).
[
2
]
In Jinx's most hopeless moment, where she attempted to "break the cycle" and protect her sister by blowing herself up with a hextech grenade, Jinx, in a slightly aggressive and tired manner of speech, refused to talk to Ekko and blew him up with her. It took Ekko three tries rewinding time with his
Z-Drive
to find the right words to convince her not to activate the grenade. During these three tries, Jinx told him to "Get out of here,", kept silent, and "too late" during the third try. Eventually, he reminded Jinx of their old friendship and asked her not to blow them both up, and upon realizing he would be caught in the blast, Jinx decided to fall to her death instead of activating the device so he would not be hurt. After yet another rewind, Ekko managed to convince Jinx that her life was worth saving by saying that no matter what happened in the past, it was never too late to "
build something new, someone worth building it for.
" Jinx's survival had become important to Ekko because, unbeknownst to Jinx, he had both met and fallen in love with a version of her in an alternate universe, where
hextech
was never invented, Zaun was thriving, his friends and loved ones were alive, and Ekko and Powder had never stopped being friends after their childhood had ended.
Ekko later invited Jinx to the
Firelights
hideout, and they and managed to unite the people of Zaun to save Piltover from Ambessa's invasion. After Jinx had seemingly perished in an explosion, Ekko privately mourned her during the funeral, sitting alone at the spot where he and the alternate
Powder
had kissed.

Caitlyn Kiramman

Jinx's entire perception of Caitlyn was twisted before she even met her.
Vi's
intimate relationship with an Enforcer confused Jinx and made her jealous, since she not only felt replaced but also thought Vi was not sincere in wanting her back. Rather, Jinx was worried Vi was trying to undermine her criminal activities in order to please her Enforcer girlfriend. She would be haunted by hallucinations of Caitlyn during her shimmer operation. At one point, she would even offer Vi an ultimatum: kill Caitlyn in exchange for getting Powder back, as she saw Caitlyn as a villain who stole Vi from her. After Vi refused the ultimatum, Jinx proceeded to kill Caitlyn's mother,
Cassandra
, in her attack on the Council, though Jinx was not aware that Caitlyn's mother was present in the building until after the fact.
After her mother's death, Caitlyn became obsessed with hunting down Jinx, but had become largely indifferent to Caitlyn, as she was no longer concerned about Vi possibly abandoning her again, even playfully mocking Vi's romantic feelings towards Caitlyn. Their rivalry would continue for some time, with Caitlyn repeatedly trying and failing to find the right leads that would let her capture Jinx, and Jinx largely given up on attacking
Piltover
and simply hiding in her lair. Eventually, Caitlyn would give up her search, as she realized she had been torturing herself by feeding her own hatred.
When Caitlyn eventually sided with Vi over
Ambessa
, Jinx saved her life and seemingly accepted that Caitlyn and Vi deserved to be happy together, apologizing for killing her mother and letting Caitlyn take her revenge on her. Caitlyn refused, and secretly allowed Vi the chance to sneak past the guards and free her sister from her cell. After Jinx had seemingly perished in the final battle, Caitlyn appeared suspicious that Jinx was truly gone and began to investigate the Hexgate schematics and the remains of her monkey bomb.

Claggor

Claggor was Jinx's elder adopted brother back when she was still Powder. Unlike Mylo, Claggor was usually calm, quiet, and caring toward Powder and didn't ridicule her. After the bomb exploded during the rescue mission of Vander, he died. Jinx built a doll version of him, including his signature goggles. She doesn't hear his voice as much as the other ones of her deceased family. After his death, Jinx would sometimes use his goggles while constructing machinery, until they were eventually taken by
Vi
.

Mylo

Mylo was her elder adopted brother back when she was still Powder. He'd often ridicule her for her clumsiness and incompetence for completing missions, saying she jinxed every mission, and often compared her to her older sister. They often butted heads, where Mylo struggled with things Powder exceeded in, such as shooting. After Powder was left behind during the rescue mission of Vander, she eventually came to try to help ultimately leading to Mylo's death. Jinx is later haunted by his voice, becoming the embodiment of her doubts, anxieties, and self ridicule. She also dressed a mannequin up in his image to talk to in her lair. After Silco's death, she almost stopped hearing Mylo's voice, finally coming to terms with her identity as a "jinx." Echoes of her ghosts appeared at the moment when Jinx panicked because Isha was captured and thrown into prison.

Isha


Isha is a little girl from Zaun whom Jinx saved from
Chross'
chem-goons, after which Isha began to follow Jinx. At first, Jinx treated Isha as a small and fun addition to her life, who simply tagged along as she and
Sevika
fought Vi and Caitlyn. During a fight with Vi and Caitlyn, Isha protected Jinx by putting herself between them, and Jinx was seemingly confused as to how Isha could possibly care about her.
After a while, Isha and Jinx began living together and they would become friends, arranging fighting matches between Jinx's pet bugs Stink Maw and Scuttle Butt. Isha's presence had a good effect on Jinx, making her calmer and happier, and she would put more lights and colors in her previously gloomy lair. They spent a lot of time together while Jinx was in hiding, having fun, dancing, painting grafitti and walking around the city together. Isha was shown to deeply admire Jinx and began to imitate her appearance and behavior. She had drawings in the form of clouds, like Jinx tattoos, and many X marks, similar to the cross on Jinx's chest. Eventually, Isha later asked Jinx to dye her hair blue, similar to the Jinxers.
Jinx showed a lot of concern for Isha's safety. She mentioned in a conversation with Silco's chair that she found a friend whom she would not like to lose. When she found out that Isha was captured by Enforcers and Noxians, Jinx became visibly panicked and experienced hallucinations, and while Isha could be seen among these, she did not appear aggressive like the others. At Stillwater, Jinx was ready to fight Warwick to distract him while Sevika brought Isha to safety. She also stopped fighting with Vi in the mines after Isha got hurt, and would remain close to her while encouraging her. When Isha eventually sacrificed herself to save Jinx from the raging Warwick, Jinx became deeply depressed, believing this proved that the people she cared about were doomed to suffer because of her.
Jinx would eventually memorialize Isha in the design of her war balloon and her costume, with much of the decorative paint job being associated with Isha and Jinx drawings.

Sevika


After Jinx was adopted by
Silco
, Sevika rose to the rank of second-in-command, responsible for making sure her boss's operations went smoothly. However, she and Jinx had a strained relationship, as both competed for Silco's favor and Jinx was responsible for destroying her arm. Sevika saw Jinx as a loose cannon, unhinged and often prone to violent outbursts that result in things going out of control. Still, Sevika's respect for Silco was ultimately stronger than her hostility to Jinx, and they managed to work together for a long time, with Sevika even giving Silco parenting advice on occasion.
After Silco's death, a power struggle between the chembarons began in Zaun, with some of them thinking it'd be better to hand Jinx over to the Topsiders. Despite the difficult relationship with Jinx, Sevika refused, saying that she would not give up her people. Sevika and Jinx met again in Silco's office, and although Sevika initially thought Jinx wanted to kill her, they eventually bonded over the fact that they both missed Silco. As a reconciliation gift, Jinx made a new arm for Sevika, which appeared specially-designed to suit her love for gambling, and Sevika saved multiple times in return, first against
Smeech
and later against
Caitlyn
and
Vi
.
When Jinx became a symbol in the undercity against Piltovan oppression, and Sevika sought to use her newfound image to complete Silco's dream of a united nation of Zaun. However, Jinx was disinterested in being viewed as a hero, in large part due to her low self-image. The matter led to several arguments between Sevika and Jinx, but Sevika still hoped Jinx would change her mind and join her at the rally. Later on, Jinx and Sevika teamed up directly to rescue
Isha
and the others from Stillwater Hold, and Sevika obeyed Jinx's request to get Isha to safety as she distracted Warwick, showing faith in Jinx's abilities as a fighter.
While Sevika was initially reluctant to help Piltover in their war against the
Noxians
, she later arrived as part of the Zaunite force following Jinx's war balloon, suggesting that Jinx was the one who changed her mind by uniting the undercity against
Ambessa
and
Viktor
.

Singed

Jinx and Singed were both notorious henchmen of Silco's criminal empire, but did not interact to a great extent, as the doctor was often away working in his laboratory. Still, Jinx was familiar enough with his work to believe he'd be capable of developing a hextech weapon, and asked Silco to give the gemstone to him instead. Silco did not trust Singed as much as he trusted Jinx, and she eventually decided to crack the hextech without Singed's help.
[
10
]
Later, when Jinx had been critically wounded in her battle with Ekko, Silco brought Jinx to Singed for treatment. The doctor's procedure was long and excruciating, worsening her already fragile mental state, but Singed appeared largely callous to how much pain he was causing Jinx. When the procedure was finished, Jinx escaped from his lab with new superhuman abilities, and the doctor was simply satisfied that he had "saved her life."
[
3
]
Jinx encountered Singed again in Stillwater Hold, but she did not interact with him, nor did she seem to be aware that he was the creator of
Warwick
, the chemtech beast that was attacking them. After getting Isha to safety and learning Warwick was Vander, she did not return to free Singed from his cell, indicating she did not care what happened to him.
