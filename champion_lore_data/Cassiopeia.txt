Early life
[

Born as a noble of
Noxus
, Cassiopeia Du Couteau had a sharp mind and wit at an early age, and very early on in her life the Du Couteau family moved to
Urzeris
,
Shurima
. While her older sister
Katarina
trained under their father
Marcus
to be an assassin, Cassiopeia was taught by her mother
Soreana
how to use a position of authority. One day, Soreana fell ill as a result of an assassination attempt through poisoning her hairbrush. With Marcus removing the house staff, Cassiopeia tended to her mother, where the two developed a closer bond as Soreana recovered.
When Marcus and Katarina returned to Noxus, Cassiopeia remained in Urzeris with her mother. Soreana told her the truth that she was part of the
Black Rose
cult, which had managed to influence Shurima. As Cassiopeia grew to adulthood, Soreana mentored her to be a cunning and manipulative figure who could use those around her as tools before disposing of them when given the chance. Cassiopeia was initiated into the Black Rose by stealthily assassinating those who plotted Soreana's death.
After gaining her role with the Black Rose's plans, Cassiopeia raided Shuriman ruins with the help of a Shuriman mercenary named
Sivir
. When Soreana received the news that her husband honored
Jericho Swain's
coup against
Boram Darkwill
, she realized that the Black Rose would be in danger, so she instructed Cassiopeia to obtain Shurima's godly power. Swearing to her mother's oath, Cassiopeia raided the underground Tomb of the Forgotten with Sivir. She backstabbed Sivir with her dagger before reaching for the artifact, the Chalikar to open the doors to the tomb and gain the
God-Warriors'
power of Ascension.
However, Cassiopeia was bitten by a stone snake guardian which guarded the tomb, painfully transforming her into a half-human, half-snake hybrid. Falling into despair, Cassiopeia mourned her lost life for weeks, but eventually moved on and accepted her new form, hoping for her newfound Ascended magic to have potential for the Black Rose.

The Shedding of Skin

Getting used to her new form while overlooking Urzeris, Cassiopeia felt an urge to hunt down a Noxian soldier she held contempt for. Lurking out of his view, she admonished him for killing children for drake meat for profit and killing three people while leaving them unrecognizable. Calling out to her to show herself, Cassiopeia revealed her monstrous appearance to him. She wrapped her tail around the soldier, feeling sadistic satisfaction towards his pain. He recognized her as Lady Cassiopeia and taunted her about how she lost her nobility. In response, Cassiopeia released all of her pent-up emotions as she petrified him into stone. Feeling satisfaction that her new cursed form allowed her to take what she wanted, she smashed the petrified soldier as she eagerly plotted to attack her next victim.

Appearance

Cassiopeia is a slim woman who wears only a Shuriman headdress, bra and armbands on her elbows. After being transformed by her curse, her legs turned into a long green snake tail merged into her body with a golden belt, and her fingers have become golden with an adorned jewel on the back of each hand. She has black sclera with glowing lime irises and slitted pupils. She has snake-like fangs in place of teeth and a forked tongue.

Personality

Cassiopeia is a treacherous, manipulative schemer who takes any opportunity she can to further her goals. She has an individualistic philosophy, seeing others as tools to exploit. After transforming into her cursed form, she initially felt disgust towards her new body and despair from losing her old life as a noble, but embraced her new form as a way to enact her goals herself. Though Cassiopeia's new capabilities have made her sadistic and predatory, she still has moral standards and prefers to hunt those more evil than herself, such as when she admonished and killed a Noxian soldier whom committed inhumane crimes.
