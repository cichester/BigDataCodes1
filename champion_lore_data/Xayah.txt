Early life
[

Xayah's early life was shaped by her deep connection to her tribe and her fierce loyalty to their ancient heritage. As a child, she loved hearing her father sing folk-hymns of vastayan heroes, songs that filled her with a sense of pride and longing for a time when magic and the spirit realm freely intertwined with the physical world. However, the beauty of these melodies was overshadowed by the harsh reality that each generation of vastaya was growing weaker, as humans continued to encroach upon their lands and drain the natural magic of Ionia for their own purposes.
Unlike the rest of her people, who chose to withdraw and avoid conflict, Xayah refused to stand by and watch her tribe fade. Driven by a need to protect her kind, she defied her tribe’s decrees and ventured into human villages, seeking a way to reason with them. But her journey into the outside world opened her eyes to the cruelty and ignorance of mortals. Rather than finding allies, she was met with hostility and greed—villagers sought to steal her feathers as trophies, and authorities were summoned to capture her. Forced to defend herself, Xayah unleashed her deadly quills on those who attacked her, showing no mercy to anyone who stood in her way.
Shaken and disillusioned, Xayah returned home, only to find her worst fear realized—her tribe, including her father, had mysteriously vanished. Worse still, she discovered that an ancient temple had been corrupted by shadow magic, severing its connection to the spirit realm and cutting off the remaining magic that sustained the land. Determined to restore balance, Xayah destroyed the temple, dispelling the dark magic and bringing life back to the land. Yet, despite this small victory, her people were still missing.
From that moment on, Xayah became a solitary figure. She dedicated herself to the fight for vastayan freedom, moving like a shadow through enemy strongholds, leaving a trail of bodies behind her. Her relentless pursuit of justice earned her the title "The Violet Raven." Though her early life was marked by loss and disillusionment, Xayah's resolve to restore her people's power and reclaim their lands became her driving force. She lived for the next mission, the next battle, always striving to free Ionia’s magic and bring her tribe back from the brink of extinction.

In her current life, Xayah is a seasoned freedom fighter, fiercely dedicated to the cause of restoring the vastayan tribes to their former glory. After years of watching her Lhotlan tribe reduced to rootless nomads by human encroachment and betrayal, she took matters into her own hands, becoming a pivotal figure in the growing vastayan rebellion across Ionia. No longer interested in negotiations, Xayah uses her lethal quills in battle to release the wild magic of the land, moving like a shadow through fortified human settlements and leaving a trail of enemies behind her. Known as "The Violet Raven," her relentless dedication and unmatched skills have made her a feared and respected symbol of the rebellion.
Though Xayah often worked alone, believing that no one could accomplish the mission better than she, her life changed when she met Rakan, a flamboyant fellow vastaya, in the remote town of Vlonqo. Initially dismissing him as a buffoon, Xayah found herself surprised by Rakan’s effectiveness in battle, using his showmanship and charisma to distract enemies while she dealt the killing blows. Despite her initial irritation with his free-spirited and theatrical nature, Rakan’s unwavering loyalty and charm gradually won her over, and she realized she had grown fond of his presence.
Now, Xayah and Rakan fight side by side, their contrasting personalities complementing each other in battle. Where Xayah is focused, direct, and ruthless, Rakan brings chaos, distraction, and emotional insight, making them a formidable duo. Over time, their bond deepened, and Xayah learned to appreciate Rakan’s lightness and spontaneity, qualities she once found aggravating but now finds comforting. Together, they have become inseparable, each strengthening the other’s resolve in their shared mission to reclaim the First Lands for the vastaya.
With their growing reputation and the aftermath of the Noxian invasion making Ionia more volatile, Xayah and Rakan have managed to rally countless vastaya to their cause. They are no longer just two rebels fighting alone; they are the leaders of a movement that seeks to restore the magic of Ionia and bring their people back to prominence. Their dream of rebellion is closer to fruition than ever, and together they will stop at nothing to see the vastaya thrive once more.

Personality

Xayah’s personality is of blending intensity, cynicism, and a deep, though often hidden, emotional core. She is fiercely independent and unapologetically blunt, with a sharp tongue and little tolerance for anything—or anyone—that slows her down. Her sarcastic remarks and disdain for superficial things, like flowers or bright sunlight, reflect her pragmatic and no-nonsense attitude, especially when it comes to her mission as a freedom fighter.
However, beneath this tough, edgy exterior lies a softer side, particularly in her relationship with Rakan. While she often finds him exasperating, noisy, and distractible, she deeply cares for him, as seen in her vulnerable moments of affection. Xayah’s love for Rakan is intense and protective, even if she expresses it in a somewhat possessive or aggressive way. Her bond with him allows her to experience moments of peace, softness, and even a rare sense of safety, though she tries to hide how much he means to her behind teasing and sharp words.
Xayah’s humor is dark, sardonic, and often laced with aggression, especially when people get on her nerves. She prefers the night, where she feels safe enough to when she's alone, finds comfort in silence, and despises frivolity, which contrasts with her sharp, often biting, wit. Despite her hardened exterior, her emotional depth is revealed in her protective nature toward Rakan and her overwhelming desire to see her people thrive again.
