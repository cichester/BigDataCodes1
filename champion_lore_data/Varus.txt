Early Life
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Varus was born in the ancient
Shuriman empire
, where he was a paragon of loyalty and honor. Because of his dedication and skills in archery, Varus was appointed to be a temple warden and sent out to guard the temples of the eastern states. During the early stages of the
Icathian Uprising
, many of the outlying villages were attacked, including Varus's own homeland. Though the other wardens abandoned their posts to join the defense, Varus upheld his oaths and remained at his post, singlehandedly defending the temple. Knowing that his family had been killed during the attack, Varus was anguished and grieved the loss of his family as he fought off the invaders.

Ascension

]

In the aftermath, Varus was found by emissaries of the
Ascended Host
kneeling in deep meditation and surrounded by corpses of his foes. Though successful in defending the temple, the event left Varus horribly traumatized by the event. Despite his unnerving and cold gaze, Varus was offered to join the Ascended as a reward for his noble sacrifice and dedication.
Even as an Ascended God-Warrior, Varus remained bitter and consumed with a vicious desire for vengeance against the Icathians because of what they did to his homeland and family. He continued to participate in the war and pushed back the rebelling Icathians and the horrors of the
Void
that they unleashed. During this, he reveled in tormenting his enemies to the point of insanity, torturing them with arrows before painfully killing them. Even after Shurima's eventual victory over Icathia, Varus didn't fully comprehend it as his mind had become so twisted that all of the memories of his atrocities blurred together, leaving him as a withdrawn and heartless killer.

The Great Darkin War

Aatrox
and
Rhaast

After the sudden death of emperor
Azir
, the
Shuriman empire fell
and the many Ascended, now calling themselves
Sunborn
, clashed with one another in bitter rivalries due to the lack of leadership. Their war would be so devastating that mortals began to call these beings the
Darkin
,
an ancient Shuriman world most closely translated to
The Fallen,
and the
Great Darkin War
began.
[

]
Varus, who's mind was still twisted beyond repair, couldn't fully comprehend the war happening and instead fully embraced his life as a killer as he was often sent off by his Darkin siblings to assassinate enemy commanders and obliterate entire armies. During the war, Varus fought alongside many of his fellow Darkin, who he considered his brothers and sisters in arms. It's implied that he was a member of a group of five Darkin who were exceptionally powerful and destined to bring ruin to the whole world. These Darkin included
Aatrox
,
Rhaast
,
Naafiri
and an unknown fifth Darkin. At one point, Varus fought alongside his Darkin sister Valeeva, who shared the same desire for violent revenge against those that wronged them.

The
Celestial beings
of
Targon
eventually intervened in the war and the
5
Aspect of War
began gathering entire armies of mortals to fight back against the Darkin while Myisha, the
Aspect of Twilight
, taught mortals how to magically imprison them within their own weapons.
[

]
After being cornered by a group of
vastayan moon-stalkers
and human mages serving a golden-armored warrior queen from
Valoran
, Varus was defeated and bound within his bow. The queen, knowing the risks of handling a Darkin weapon, still chose to wield it during the final days of the war, slowly succumbing to Varus's corruption and turning monstrous. Months later, the warrior queen travelled to the
First Lands
with Varus in hand and gave a final command to her followers to seal her within a well beneath the mountain temple at
Pallas
, sacrificing herself and imprisoning Varus within the magical well.

Modern History
[

edit source
]

For centuries Varus remained hidden within the well, untouched and mostly forgotten. The people of Pallas remained as custodians to the temple, though largely forgetting the ancient history surrounding it but still being wary of the Darkin being imprisoned within.

Valmar and Kai

Ionian hunters
Valmar
and
Kai
fighting off invading Noxians.

At one point an Ionian hunter named
Valmar
was born in Pallas and grew up to be a skilled hunter alongside his lover
Kai
. The two eventually travelled to Pallas to visit Valmar's family and, while at the sacred temple, faced the first wave of
Noxian
invaders. Valmar and Kai fought back the invaders together to defend their homeland, leading to Kai getting mortally wounded. Now grief-stricken, Valmar began to hear whispers coming out of the forbidden well within the temple. Valmar succumbed to Varus's persuasion and carried Kai into the well with him, believing that the forbidden magic can restore his lover.
[

]
As the two swam within the well of Pallas, Varus managed to break down and remake the mortal bodies of Valmar and Kai into a brand new body, repurposing their flesh and souls. Varus emerged out of the well as a unique creature with pale, inhuman beauty; a hybrid of human and Darkin.

Rebirth
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Soon after Varus climbed out of the well, he realized he could hear the voices of Valmar and Kai within his own mind as separate personalities. The two of them cried out in pain over their new existence, as Varus's imperfect hybrid form allowed the two hunters to remain conscious within his body, becoming a body for not one but three souls. Despite this, Varus reveled in his newfound freedom and immediately began slaughtering the invading Noxians within Pallas. During this, Valmar's hatred for Noxians was emphasized by Varus's cruelty as he supported Varus's slaughter. On the other hand, Kai began to lament his lover succumbing to Varus's influence. When Varus attempted to kill Ionians, Valmar began to struggle for control over Varus's body. Eventually, Kai and Valmar realized that their love for one another was strong enough to overcome Varus's hatred, allowing them to take full control for a time. While Valmar took control of the body, he confronted his mother and bid her farewell, believing that he was too dangerous to keep around the village and decided to travel out of Ionia.
The three constantly struggled for control, with Valmar and Kai constantly trying to quell Varus's cruelty. Varus on the other hand went on a vicious pursuit for vengeance against the world, seeking to reunite the rest of his Darkin siblings together and eventually silence the mortal voices within him.

Search for Naafiri
[

edit source
]

Varus's quest to reunite the remaining Darkin eventually brought him back to Shurima, where he was guided by a crook-backed birdlike creature with a withered arm, most likely one of the
Baccai
. Here he sought out his Darkin sister
Naafiri
, investigating noises coming from sunken ruins in the distance. Here he sensed the same magic used by the golden-armored queen who imprisoned him and found a group of graverobbers digging out the ruins with beasts of burden.
Varus quickly killed most of the excavators while the rest of them quickly fled as Valmar and Kai managed to convince Varus to spare them. Once within the ruins, Varus glanced past statues of other Ascended and magically inscribed flagstones in order to find his sister, only to find that the tomb was empty and realizing that Naafiri had already escaped.

Redemption
[

While Varus continued his quest to reunite the Darkin, the three personalities within him learned to coexist as Valmar and Kai came to realize the humanity that remained within Varus. The two slowly prompted Varus to remember the honorable man he once was in the past, urging him to return to that and slowly redeeming his mind from his mad desire for vengeance. Now fully embracing the sum of his parts, Varus began to act as a singular being as his three personalities fought in unison. Though he continues to be bitter against the world that imprisoned him, he now fights with hope that he can return to the honorable man he once was.

After
Xolaani
managed to possess a

new vessel
in Ionia,
Aatrox
rallied for the rest of the Darkin to join him in Icathia and destroy her.
[

Varus however didn't answer the call immediately and instead sought to gather a party of skilled warriors to aid him in hunting down Xolaani.
By travelling across the world, Varus met many individuals who he convinced to join him on his hunt, empowering their weapons with a fraction of his own Darkin magic. This party consisted of an
4
ambitious scientist
from
Zaun
who wanted to study the Darkin magic, a
1
sea monster hunter
of the
Buhru
culture wishing to use it to hunt down leviathans, a disgruntled
5
archer
of the
Avarosans
seeking to destroy the
Winter's Claw
and finally a
2
member
of the
Lunari
cult who sought to end the war between the Lunari and the
Solari
. The party travelled together to Icathia and finally faced off against Xolaani, though the outcome remains unknown.

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

While imprisoned, Varus is trapped as a large, purple, organic bow with sharp spikes that almost resemble tree bark. The bow can produce a deep red and purple glow when firing arrows and can split apart horizontally.
His current physical form is a fusion of his Darkin essence mixed with a human body made from the repurposed bodies of
Valmar
and
Kai
. Varus stands taller than the average mortal and has pale skin accompanied by dark purple growths across his forearms and the lower half of his body. Varus has pure white hair and eyes with a general face that is inhumanely beautiful to the point where it can be unsettling for mortals to look at him. He wears a red scarf that flows freely across his neck, a crown adorned with a red gem at its center and a leather strap covering the glowing purple wound in his heart, representative of the wound that nearly killed Kai.
It is unknown what Varus looked like in his Ascended form but it's possible that his current form somewhat resembles it.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

As a mortal, Varus was a noble and honorable man willing to remain dedicated to his duties no matter what. Varus's loyalty to his sacred duty ran so deep that he refused to leave his post when the
Icathians
attacked his homeland and slaughtered his family, leaving him anguished and traumatized by the experience.
As an Ascended, Varus grew bitter and even more violently vengeful against others, especially the Icathians that killed his family. Varus enjoyed torturing his enemies to the point of insanity before killing them as a way to sate his desire for vengeance. He had committed so many atrocities that his mind began to break even further as the many atrocities he committed slowly began to blur together, leaving Varus to see himself as nothing but a cold-hearted killer.
After emerging out of the well of
Pallas
, Varus aimed his vengeance against the mortals that imprisoned him, wishing to destroy the entire world and reunite his Darkin siblings to do so. He completely disregarded mortal life, specifically humans, feeling disgusted by their frailty and bitter against the world that betrayed him.
Valmar and Kai remain within Varus's mind, acting as separate personalities that constantly fight for control. Kai is the more gentler of his personalities, often trying to convince Varus to be merciful and spare mortal lives. Valmar on the other hand is similar to Varus because of his deep hatred against
Noxians
and desire for vengeance, but still clashes with him over Varus's indiscriminate slaughter. The two use their hope and love for one another as a means of overpowering Varus, gaining control of his body for short periods of time. While Varus initially wished to corrupt or silence their voices, Valmar and Kai have managed to appeal to Varus's humanity, reminding him of the noble man he once was and convincing him to seek redemption. Embracing the sum of his parts, Varus's personalities now act in unison as he now seeks a way to regain his humanity, questioning if he's truly worthy of redemption. Though he's still a merciless killer at times, he has shown to have a renewed sense of honor and has even opened himself up to alliances with other mortals.

Abilities
[

edit source
]

Darkin Hybrid Physiology:
Varus is a Darkin, originally one of the many
Ascended
God-Warriors of
Shurima
now trapped within a weapon. Since taking up the vessels
Valmar
and
Kai
, Varus emerged as a unique hybrid of Darkin and human, a Darkin unlike any other. The Darkin part of him grants Varus immense physical strength and access to some celestial magics.
Immortality:
Because his consciousness is trapped within his indestructible bow, Varus is functionally immortal and immune to aging and dying as there is no known way to permanently kill him or destroy his bow.
Gestalt Consciousness:
Because of his unique physiology, the consciousnesses of Valmar and Kai remain within Varus's mind as separate personalities. Though Varus is mainly in control of his body, Valmar and Kai are capable of communicating with Varus and can even take full control of his body for short periods of time. When reminded of his humanity, Varus can learn to embrace his separate personalities and the three can act in unison as a singular being.
Corruption Manipulation:
Varus can control a corruptive magic related to his Darkin abilities. The exact nature of this magic is unknown but it's most likely some form of celestial magic Varus retained from his time as an Ascended. Varus can use this corruption to immobilize and poison his enemies as well as empower his allies, granting them a fraction of his own power and enchanting their weapons. Varus is not limited to empowering people as he's been shown to corrupt
3
plants
as well.
Hemomancy:
Like most Darkin, Varus utilizes hemomancy to manipulate the flesh and blood of mortals for his own purposes. Varus utilized hemomancy to break down the bodies of Valmar and Kai, reconstructing them into his new form.
Bow Proficiency:
Varus has been a talented archer since his life as a mortal, having been skilled enough to be appointed as a temple warden by the Shuriman empire. As a warden, Varus was skilled enough to defend the entire temple singlehandedly during the
Icathian Uprising
, becoming recognized and honored by the Ascended God-Warriors themselves.
Darkin Bow:
Varus wields his Darkin Bow, which is capable of generating
arrows made of corruptive magic
, which he can fire either as concentrated shots or as a
hail
.

Relations
[

Darkin
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Varus regards most of his fellow Darkin as his brothers and sisters at arms, having fought alongside and against them during the
Great Darkin War
. During this war, Varus was often sent out by his Darkin siblings to assassinate enemy generals and obliterate entire armies. At some point during the war, it's implied that Varus fought alongside four other Darkin that were notably powerful and destined to one day reunite and bring ruin to the world. These notable Darkin are
Aatrox
,
Rhaast
,
Naafiri
and a currently unknown fifth Darkin.
After emerging from the well of
Pallas
, Varus focused on enacting brutal vengeance against the world by reuniting the rest of his Darkin siblings, especially the four others destined to unite with him. After his separate personalities appealed to the humanity lost within him, Varus instead focused on fighting for himself and to possibly regain his lost humanity rather than for the Darkin.

Valeeva
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Valeeva was one of the Darkin present during the earliest days of the war, being regarded as a sister by Varus. After the
Aspect of Twilight
killed several Darkin and learned to imprison the rest, Valeeva was one of the survivors but hasn't been seen by Varus since.

Naafiri
[
edit
|
edit source
]

When Varus emerged out of Pallas, one of his first missions lead him back to the deserts of
Shurima
in search of Naafiri, who he deeply regards as his sister. While searching for her in a Shuriman tomb, he comes to realize that it has already been emptied, meaning Naafiri managed to escape before Varus's arrival.
Naafiri is one of the five Darkin destined to reunite with Varus in bringing the world to ruin. Though it's unclear whether or not the two have reunited since his search for her, Varus deeply respects Naafiri's sense of unity, seeing it as strength and wishing to apply the concept to the rest of his Darkin siblings to work together.

Aatrox
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Aatrox is one of the most respected of the Darkin and the first to be imprisoned during the Great Darkin War. It's implied that Varus fought alongside Aatrox at some point during the war, as he is one of the five Darkin destined to reunite and bring ruin to the world. Though the two share a desire the bring oblivion to the world, Varus wishes to do so out of pure revenge, an emotion Aatrox thinks is weak and unbecoming of him as he criticizes the hybrid form he has taken.
It's implied there was some 'memo' given to Varus by Aatrox which explained that Varus had to use two A's in his name, officially naming him "Vaarus." However, Varus thought the memo was absurd and refused to comply, angering and offending Aatrox.

Rhaast
[
edit
|
edit source
]

It's implied that Rhaast was one of the five Darkin that fought alongside Varus during the Darkin War but there exact relationship is unclear. He jokingly refers to Varus as "Demon-Pants".

Xolaani
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Varus is actively against Xolaani and is familiar with her infamy during the Darkin War, which is common among the rest of the Darkin. When she awoke and captured a
3
new host body
, Varus eventually caught word of her awakening, which empowered him to embrace his other personalities and gather a hunting party of other archers, which he empowered with his own magic. Together, they rallied to
Icathia
and faced off Xolaani.

Valmar
[
edit
|
edit source
]

After becoming his vessel, Varus took advantage of Valmar's grief, urging him to embrace vengeance against the
Noxians
that killed Kai. Thanks to Kai's influence, Valmar was able to resist Varus' temptations and together they tried to dissuade Varus from his path of vengeance, eventually succeeding in breaking through to him.

Kai
[
edit
|
edit source
]

When he became a vessel for Varus, Kai was initially horrified towards his new existence and wished to have remained dead, but resisted Varus' attempts to corrupt Valmar into falling to vengeance by reminding him of their love. Kai is the more merciful of the two voices and pleads for Varus to spare the lives of his enemies as well as knowing that Varus has the capability for redemption, and together with Valmar he succeeds in helping him realize his humanity.
