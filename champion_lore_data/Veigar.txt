Search for Knowledge

Veigar's early life in
Bandle City
. remains a mystery, but it is known that he grew dissatisfied with traditional Yordle magic. Longing to expand his knowledge, he ventured into the human world, drawn by the ancient secrets of celestial magic. Under the guidance of mortal masters, Veigar quickly excelled in harnessing the power of the stars. However, his talent attracted the attention of the ruthless warlord
Mordekaiser
, who was then conquering the lands of
Valoran
. Unskilled in the art of war, mages were easy prey for Mordekaiser's cruelty. Seeing potential in the Yordle’s arcane abilities, Mordekaiser captured Veigar and took him into his dark dominion.

Enslaved by Mordekaiser

Bound to the physical realm by Mordekaiser, Veigar found himself enslaved, cut off from Bandle City. Forced to twist his magic for the tyrant’s cruel purposes, Veigar was subjected to relentless torment and manipulation, until the once-curious Yordle’s spirit began to fracture. His captor used him as an instrument of terror, pushing Veigar to inflict suffering upon those who opposed Mordekaiser’s reign. Suffering from isolation, Veigar's memories faded, but he clung to them like the last rays of light before an eclipse. And accompanying his torment he saw how Mordekaiser's corrupted actions had led him to something close to immortality. Over time, after decades or centuries, these dark experiences transformed both Veigar’s personality and his appearance, leaving scars he could not erase.
Though Mordekaiser’s rule seemed absolute, it ultimately crumbled under rebellion, as his
servants
and the Noxii tribes—led by their
god
—overthrew the tyrant.

Breaking Free
[

edit source
]

After defeating a
warlord
, Vixis the Cruel, and seizing her tower for himself, Veigar tries to scare the local villagers.

With Mordekaiser’s downfall, Veigar finally escaped his enchanted cage. Although he had little interest in the ensuing power struggles, he found himself irrevocably altered, unable to shed the darkness that had consumed him, despite his deep desire for the safety, peace, and freedom that all living beings crave. Instead, he embraced his new identity as an ‘evil’ sorcerer, using his magic as a weapon, harnessing the wrath of the stars and trapping his enemies into the timeless infinity between moments to gain respect and independence.
Unlike his former captor, however, Veigar’s actions often took an ambiguous turn. Though he sometimes scorched farmlands and destroyed barons' estate he also drove out brigands, vanquished dark creatures, and defeated evil warlocks, seizing their powerful artifacts. To the people of Valoran, Veigar’s intentions were murky at best; his deeds seemed to straddle the line between malevolent and strangely beneficial.

Rise as a Dark Lord
[

Veigar embraces his leadership over the
minions
and his Yordle-followers.
Veigar eventually seized a fortress of his own, transforming it into a bastion of dark sorcery and gathering a legion of peculiar followers. His court was a theatrical assembly of devoted Yordles and minions, each serving a specialized role in his dark domain. Among them for example, the
2
Twisted Catalyzer
absorbed the darkness from tainted fairies, freeing them and returning them to their original form. The ancient scrolls and long-lost magics of Runeterra were revived under the care of the
3
Wizened Wizard
, while the
4
Stilted Robemaker
worked tirelessly on the crucial task of outfitting Veigar’s court with sinister style—often boosting Veigar’s stature, if not his height.
Veigar and his troops embark on a campaign towards darkness, traveling through Yordle Pathways.
Also in his retinue were the
4
Tenor of Terror
and his brother, the Bass of Burden, whose voices sang of Veigar’s looming reign. And a mysterious
8
Mirror Mage
, that may be intertwined with the past of Veigar himself.
Within his castle, Veigar’s forces grew stronger. Dangerous artifacts and forbidden knowledge accumulated, resulting in monstrous war machines like the Grand Overseer, a combat mecha equipped with the fearsome
Rabadon's Deathcap
and the sinister
Morellonomicon
. This mechanical marvel embodied Veigar’s grim ingenuity and rising military power, a testament to his quest for unmatched might.
And he also wrote a book ''How to be a Supervillain''.

Appearance
[

Veigar is a small, even for yordle standards, individual. His form is almost entirely concealed beneath a deep blue and purple cloak, adorned with rows of metallic spikes along the shoulders. Atop his head sits a massive, pointed hat, also studded with spikes. His right glove is unusually large and armored. Veigar wields in his left hand a heavy staff, designed like a wicked axe, topped with a glowing gem that channels his dark magic.
Beneath his cloak, Veigar has black fur and intense, stark yellow eyes that gleam with a sinister, cat-like intensity.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

When he first came to Runeterra, Veigar was an enthusiastic and curious Yordle that wished to learn more about magic. This curiosity led him to leave
Bandle City
, and go to Runeterra in search for knowledge. There he was delighted with the knowledge that he acquired and put all his effort in becoming a powerful mage.
When the warlord Mordekaiser caught him, he was tortured for year under the warlord's brutal watch. This torture broke the Yordle's mind. With his personality broken, he re-imagined himself as a terrible tyrant with a thirst for power.
Under this new persona, Veigar is obsessed with the aesthetics of villainy. He's arrogant, melodramatic, and antagonistic, constantly causing chaos in the hopes of getting the attention from others. This often leads to frustration as most of his attempts of villainy either led to mild annoyances, or instead lead to great good. He is also territorial in his search for power, aggressively going after anyone that he considers a rival in his quest for power, which often times, accidentally leads to him coming in direct blows with (and defeating) other dark sorcerers and other evils, accidentally helping many on his path.
It's possible that Veigar's acts of good might not be as accidental as it might first appear, but instead his subconscious guiding his actions towards good while his conscious mind, too broken by Mordekaiser's cruelty, rationalizes it to fit in his persona of villain.

Mordekaiser tortured Veigar to gain knowledge about other realms. Eventually, Veigar's personality would shape to be more like his captors. However, due to his yordle nature, he could never perfect his masters cruelty, only a caricature of it.
