The Ancient Fear

The origin of
Fiddlesticks
is shrouded in mystery and filled with myths, tales, and horror stories that have risen theorizing about its origin. One such story is that Fiddlesticks was accidentally released by a mage tampering with powers beyond their understanding. A story from Noxus depicts Fiddlesticks as an innocent farmboy who was blamed for a bad harvest and fed to the crows that came back as a demon. Despite no shortage of stories and theories, no one truly knows where Fiddlesticks came from.

Disappearances and The Return

Despite many tales and stories about Fiddlesticks, its existence was treated as myth by many until disappearances and sightings started happening in the
Demacian
hinterlands. This was Fiddlesticks, attracted to the rising fear and paranoia among the people of Demacia. Fiddlesticks had returned, and was coming to cause chaos.

Appearance

Fiddlesticks is mostly known as a shambling figure of scrap and shadow somewhat resembling a scarecrow. A torn burlap sackcloth rests over its "face", which is little more than two holes for glowing red eyes and a mouth of rows and rows of jagged metal teeth, secured around its "neck" by a rope which carries three keys.
A mass of red-tinged shadows grow from various points along Fiddlesticks's body, one large growth emerging from its back, and the rest occasionally forming extra arms for Fiddlesticks, of which it already has three metal ones made of rusted scrap. One of these arms is connected to its body by a sawblade which emerges from its shoulder.
At the center of Fiddlesticks's torso is a cage which houses the true essence of Fiddlesticks, as the body itself is merely puppetted around by the essence within the cage. Inside the cage is a shifting cloud of red eyes and shadowed forms from which its
crows
sprout.
However, this is only the appearance of the Demacian incarnation of Fiddlesticks. While the red-black mass of crows which makes up the essence of Fiddlesticks remains constant, the body which carries it changes based on the trash around it.

, Fiddlesticks is known to be made up of helmets, bucklers, wood, & furs.

Fiddlesticks is a creature of pure emotional instinct that doesn't understand the form it takes or the words it repeats, who was created from the formless negative energy endemic to all life.

Demon Physiology
:
Fiddlesticks is a demon, a malevolent spirit that feeds from human emotions. It has no physical form and cannot be harmed by physical weapons (unless it has magical properties). Each demon is linked to a specific emotion; in this case, Fiddlesticks feeds from fear and horrors.
Emotional Feeding:
Like other demons, Fiddlesticks nourishes itself from a specific emotion, in its case, fear. By absorbing the fear that it causes, Fiddlesticks can sustain itself for prolonged periods of time. Fiddlesticks instinctively knows one's fears.
Immortality:
So long as fear exists Fiddlesticks will exist in some form.
Demonic Magic:
Fiddlesticks has within itself a massive amount of dark power that allows it to perform many terrible feats of dark magic. it can summon constructs that look and behave almost alive, such as crows and copies of itself that will last until it chooses to let them unmake themselves. It could shift space to appear or disappear at will, like when it massacred a entire family inside their house without opening any of the doors or windows.

Though not directly equals, Fiddlesticks is still directly related to the other demons currently on Runeterra, such as
Evelynn
,
Tahm Kench
,
Nocturne
and
Raum
, the demon that
Swain
is allied with.
Along with this, Fiddlesticks's incomprehensibly ancient age may be the reason as to why it is the only champion to refer to
Kindred's
original name, referring to them as the
"Grey man"
.

Zoe at some point took a key from Fiddlesticks. It is unknown what this key does, but one story as to Fiddlesticks's origins is a
Targonian
legend that tells of how a child of twilight stole the only joy from a ragged, whispering horror.
