Fiora Laurent cuts a figure of both elegance and lethality. Her lithe frame is clad in gleaming armor, polished to a mirror shine. The armor itself is intricate Demacian steel, adorned with flourishes that hint at her noble heritage. Beneath the armor, glimpses of fine leather undergarments peek through, hinting at her agility. Her most striking feature is her face, framed by a cascade of fiery red hair. Her eyes, a piercing blue, radiate unwavering determination and focus.  In her hand, she carries her signature weapon, a rapier named Riposte. The rapier's blade is as sharp and deadly as Fiora herself, its intricate filigree hinting at its legendary status.

Tianna Crownguard
,
Garen
and
Lux's
aunt, selected a veteran warrior from the
