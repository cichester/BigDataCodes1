Gangplank
, but they went their separate ways over a decade ago. Their past relationship is implied by her liking mangos and him
oranges

Illaoi protected
Miss Fortune
and many others from an attack of the Black Mist, during which she drove off
Hecarim
with the power of her god.
Illaoi suspects
Miss Fortune
needs to be tested by her god soon. This test is briefly shown in
The Climb
.

Undead
[

]

Illaoi abhors the undead of the
Shadow Isles
and the Black Mist itself as both embody the very stagnation she seeks to eradicate. This can be illustrated when she tells
Sion
he was 'cheated of rebirth' (his soul has been trapped and unable to reincarnate as new life)

The undead would fail their test instantly.

She would want to end
Mordekaiser
the most for being the de facto puppeteer of others' souls.

Braum

Illaoi's dialogue with Braum implies that she finds Braum physically attractive. Over the course of the adventure, Braum and Illaoi develop a friendship. Illaoi would invite Braum to be more intimate and while he isn't averse to her advances, he declines because it is an inopportune time due to him needing to focus on the upcoming battles.
Illaoi's voice lines imply if she were to ever test Braum, he would pass the test very easily as he is doing exactly what Illaoi preaches: living his life as he sees fit.

Pyke
[

edit source
]

Because
Pyke
is a murderous undead, Illaoi initially saw him as a threat against the beliefs of Nagakabourous. However, after testing his spirit, she now believes him to be serving a much larger eddy and therefore staying in motion.

She had casted a spell that made Pyke more benevolent and tamed as a result of Nagakabouros' influence, but he may eventually return back to his murderous state.

Spirits
[

Illaoi views 'spirits' (
Anivia
,
Bard
,
Kindred
,
Yordles
, etc.) as a useless distraction from the truth.

Tahm Kench
would avoid her as he probably knows he would perish if Nagakabouros tested him.
