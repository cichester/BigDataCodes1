Early life
[

In life, Hecarim had been a lieutenant of the Iron Order, charged with protecting the lands owned by
King Viego
of
Camavor
.  Due to his many victories in battle, the Knight-Commander of the Order had considered Hecarim as a potential candidate to succeed him and lead the Order some day, but when the Commander realized Hecarim's growing darkness and lust for personal glory, he concluded that Hecarim should never lead the Order.  On being told of this decision by the Commander, Hecarim was furious, but returned to his duties with the Order.
During the Order's next battle, Hecarim found the Commander surrounded by enemies and cut off from reinforcements.  Hecarim chose to turn away and leave his commander to die.  After the battle, the Iron Order swore allegiance to Hecarim, unaware of his involvement in their fallen commander's death.

Ruination of Helia

On his way to be officially sworn in as the new Knight-Commander of the Iron Order, Hecarim met General
Kalista
.  The General was on a desperate mission to find a cure for the Queen, who had been poisoned by an assassin.  The King, overcome by paranoia and seeing traitors everywhere, sent the Iron Order and its new Commander to quell all dissent within Camavor.  The Order put hundreds to death and burned entire towns.  Eventually, the Queen died, presenting a new opportunity for Hecarim to advance his brutal reputation.  He proposed that the King should deploy the Order to attack Camavor's foreign enemies to avenge the murdered Queen.
The King agreed, but while the Order was preparing to ride against the kingdom's enemies, General Kalista returned, having found the antidote to the poison on the
Blessed Isles
.  Furious that his general had come too late to save his wife, the King had Kalista thrown in a cell.  Hecarim, curious about her journey, went to visit the general.  He learned of the Blessed Isles, concealed by thick, white mist and home to incredible riches â€” including the Waters of Life, which may yet be able to heal the Queen.
Hecarim convinced the King to release Kalista so she could lead a fleet back to the Blessed Isles, as she was the only one who could find the way.  Soon, Kalista, Hecarim, the Iron Order, and King Viego himself all landed at the Blessed Isles' city of
Helia
, along with the body of the dead Queen.  The expedition marched toward the city, but were was stopped by the city's leaders, who refused to help.  At this, the King ordered Kalista to kill the leaders of Helia.  When Kalista refused, Hecarim seized yet another opportunity.  He stabbed the general through the back with spear and gave the command for the Order to pillage and plunder the city.
In the ensuing havoc, a
common custodian
agree to give access to the Waters, but Hecarim was too consumed by greed and bloodlust to listen. During the continued ransacking of Helia, an enormous magical shockwave exploded across the city, destroying every building.  After the explosion subsided, a whirling storm of
The Black Mist
tore through the ruined city, engulfing all in its path.  Hecarim called for a retreat, but it was too late.  Every member of the Iron Order was consumed by the Mist, ending with Hecarim himself.  When the Mist took him, it permanently merged Hecarim with his warhorse.  He is. now an
Undead
monster; a living engine of wrath.  He is damned to endlessly patrol the now-renamed
Shadow Isles
, unable to leave except during an event known as a
Harrowing
, when the Black Mist rolls out to find new souls to join the army of Undead.

Appearance

Hecarim is an armored centaur-like wraith with a humanoid upper half and an equine lower half, as a result of him fusing with his horse after transforming into a wraith. His body is composed of metallic armor, connected by a glowing spectral body with visible hooves and tail. His head is a samurai-like helmet with an axe-like crest and skull-like teeth on its mouth. His chestplate and horse armor have skull-like faces adorning them, and has a tattered banner beneath the horse's chest. He is often seen wielding his glaive.
As mentioned when touched by Nagakaboros' powers, Hecarim's appearance as a human was described as being tall and handsome, with silver and gold armor and having dark eyes.

Personality
[

]

Hecarim is a merciless, bloodthirsty warrior who enjoys raiding cities and killing their inhabitants, mainly to gain a reputation of being feared or simply pure sadism, shown when he was so caught up with slaughtering the Helians that the Ruination took him by surprise. He is obsessed with glory and has no problem with killing his own allies to further climb up the ranks. Hecarim can also be cunning and manipulative to get what he wants, pushing Viego's grief into becoming more unhinged so he could raid enemy settlements on his command, and persuading Kalista to reveal the Blessed Isles for him. After becoming a wraith, he now seeks to kill every mortal being he comes across with the Iron Order by his side.
