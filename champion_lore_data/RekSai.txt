Rek'Sai originated in the
Void
, as the queen of the
Xer'Sai
. Thousands of years ago, she entered
Runeterra
through a portal to
Shurima
, where she and the Xer'Sai made a home within the sands, claiming parts of the region as their hunting territory and hunting anyone they found. Alongside her brood, Rek'Sai devoured thousands of people in the desert, causing the Shurimans to fear her as a bringer of death.

Scourge of the Desert

Rek'Sai was targeted by a
Noxian
hunting team attended by Aelon, a noble who intended to capture her to use in the Noxian arenas. Initially arrogant and eager to pursue her for the sake of glory, he began to humble to the Shuriman residents over time and listened to their stories of Rek'Sai. But after witnessing the destruction Rek'Sai and her brood were capable of, Aelon began to doubt his faith in the hunt. Aelon's mind was scarred by witnessing Rek'Sai's carnage firsthand, seeing her as death incarnate. While he survived the encounter thanks to his Shuriman companions' warnings, the traumatic experience caused Aelon to become disillusioned with Noxus' values, making him decide to leave the empire.

Sai Kahleek (Short Story)

Rek'Sai's territory in the
Sai Kahleek
was visited by six Shuriman teenagers and their camel. As they discussed the myths about Rek'Sai they had heard about, they heard a bell alarming them of something coming from behind them. The boys felt a jolt of Void energy before seeing their camel die within seconds. Disturbed, they tried to tiptoe towards the black rocks nearby, but the rocks moved further away.
They eventually came across a gigantic tunnel made by Rek'Sai herself, and decided to go into the tunnel in hope of finding water. Suddenly, Rek'Sai leapt out from the burrow and killed Xalee by crushing his spine with her fangs. The boys' leader, Shahib, instructed them to duck before Rek'Sai dragged Kall into her burrow. They managed to escape from the burrow but Rek'Sai followed them out, lunging at Jaheje but missing. She burrowed into the sand and knocked the group's youngest member VezKah into the air, killing him upon landing. Rek'Sai chased the remaining boys into the valley, cornering them and leaving them no choice but to run straight ahead. When Caleeb was too exhausted to continue, Rek'Sai killed him too. After witnessing a portal directly leading to the Void, the Xer'Sai's true home, Shahib encouraged Jaheje to escape and tell the story, offering to sacrifice himself to Rek'Sai as a distraction. After seeing Shahib's body getting desecrated by Rek'Sai, Jaheje broke down in tears from all the trauma he went through.
Reaching the
Renek River
as the only survivor of the group, Jaheje told his story. Few believed him at first, but many eventually realized that Jaheje was right upon witnessing the truth of the Sai Kahleek. He taught the other cast-off boys of Shurima how to survive the Sai Kahleek, warning them of Rek'Sai.

Rek'Sai
is only mentioned by
Kai'Sa
during her exploration of a chasm in
Shurima
, after meeting
Taliyah
and other rock weavers. She states that all Rek'Sai's children do is devour.

Chasms like the one found by
Kai'Sa
were once the home of the void creatures, driven to 'eat the world'.

Rek'Sai
herself doesn't appear during this story.
A fight between
Kai'Sa
,
Taliyah
, and
Rek'Sai
is depicted in the Season 2022 cinematic "The Call," likely referencing the fight between the

Appearance

edit source
]

Rek'Sai is a colossal Xer'Sai with a purple body armored with an exoskeleton of blue plates. Her body shape is scorpion-like with four insectoid legs, two gigantic forelegs with four claws each, and a barbed tail. She has four sharp upper teeth with two fleshy mandibles on either side of her mouth in place of a lower jaw. She has a shark-like fin on her back which glows with Void energy when she senses her prey.

Personality
[

edit source
]

Rek'Sai is a primitive, animalistic predator who only communicates through roars and chitters. Her main drive is to burrow through the Shuriman desert and savagely consume every lesser being she senses. She has a motherly care towards her brood and wants to protect them from
Bel'Veth
, whom mentions that the
Watchers
did not originally create her with these instincts.

Other
Voidborn

Rek'Sai,
Cho'Gath
,
Kha'Zix
,
Kog'Maw
, and
Vel'Koz
each belong to different member species of the collective known as the
Voidborn
. Rek'Sai is the queen of her Voidborn species (the Xer'Sai) as well as the largest among their number. Rek'Sai came to
Shurima
from
the Void
millennia ago (legend has it she's been around since before
Azir's
time) making her one of the Voidborn who have dwelt the longest on
Runeterra
(she has spent all this time building a portal to the Void, using the life essence of her victims as fuel to open it). Rek'Sai is
not as sapient
as the other Voidborn champions (she is to them what a dangerous animal is to humans).
