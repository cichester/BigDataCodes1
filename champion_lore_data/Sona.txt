Early Life

edit source
]

Sona was left in a monastery as an infant in the
Ionia
province of
Galrin
. No other clue about her origins is known besides a mysterious magical instrument that was delivered with her. She has a close relationship with the other children on the monastery as they would seek comfort with her.
She was moved to
Demacia
with other children when
Noxus
started its invasion on
Ionia
, around 985 AN.  She was eventually adopted into the Buvelle noble house, who were art patrons of the nation, because they took interest in her musical abilities.

Contemporary history

Some years later, around the year 990 AN, her adoptive father was killed in the Battle of the
Gates of Mourning
. The family mourned, so Lestara took Sona back to
Ionia
, so she could understand more of herself.
At some point, Sona would aid
Ryze
against the
Navori Brotherhood
so he could gather a World Rune.
When Sona perceived the animosity and disunion that struck the First Lands, she decided that was no place for her in
Ionia
anymore and she went back to
Demacia
with her mother.
