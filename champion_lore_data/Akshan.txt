Life on the Streets

Akshan grew up an orphan in the
Shuriman
city of Marwi, where brutal warlords ruled by subjugating the civilians and taking what they wanted. As a young boy, Akshan refused to let these misdeeds go unnoticed and often intervened at the sight of injustice. This eventually lead to Akshan making enemies with powerful warlords who eventually beat him to near-death, leaving him unconscious and dying on the street.
Akshan was soon found by an elderly woman named Shadya, who took him into her home and miraculously nursed him back to health. While staying with the old woman, Akshan discovered Shadya was a member of the
Sentinels of Light
; an ancient order dedicated to protecting the world from horrors of
Undead
. Despite his shortcomings as a stubborn and troubled youth, Shadya saw immense potential in Akshan due to his dedication to fighting injustice. Shadya offered to allow Akshan to safely live with her and in exchange he'd dedicate himself to the Sentinels of Light order, which Akshan happily agreed to.

Sentinel Training

Shadya and Akshan formed a fast bond, as Shadya mentored Akshan everything she knew to survive as a solo Sentinel. As Akshan's Sentinel skills grew under Shadya's tutelage, he slowly noticed his mentor growing more distant. When the time came, Shadya finally revealed to her pupil the source of her concern, that a
Harrowing
was coming, larger than the world had ever seen with an army of undead from the
Shadow Isles
. Shadya stated that their only hope in defending against this future threat is laid in a collection of ancient Sentinel weapons buried in Shurima's crypts and tombs. However, they would find most of their weapons gone, pilfered by local warlords who sought to unlock their powers for themselves. The Sentinels would try to negotiate the return of their weapons, but to no avail. With time running out, they would have to make do with what they had left.
As they took stock of their remaining arsenal, one peculiar relic gun would catch Akshan's eye, but it was quickly snatched away by Shadya, who forbade him from ever using it. This weapon was known as the Absolver, a gun that was enchanted to revive anyone who was recently killed by someone, if it kills its target. Shadya believed that only fate should wield the powers of life and death, but Akshan disagreed, believing that fate needed a little help. Akshan continued to pry for more information about the weapon until Shadya revealed the truth, she had used it to revive the young sentinel. Shadya once wielded the Absolver and slayed Akshan's would-be murderer many years ago, restoring him to life. The revelation would cause Akshan ponder what had made him so worthy of being revived. While Akshan questioned the antiquated rules of his order, Shadya continued to press the warlords to return their weapons, leading to tensions between the two groups.

Death of Shadya

Things would come to a head on one tragic day, when Akshan would find Shadya murdered on the streets. After burying her within the sentinel base of Shurima, Akshan would disregard his late-mentor's wishes and armed himself with the Absolver, after making a few modifications. Filled with vengeance, Akshan decides to abandon the sentinel's cause and prepares for a new mission: to avenge his fallen teacher. He now hunts for his mentor's killer, delivering comeuppance to one warlord at a time.

Return of the Ruined King

The great Harrowing would soon arrive, blanketing the world in Black Mist.
Lucian
and a Sentinel Rookie would come to the Shuriman Sentinel base in search of the Absolver. The two would encounter Akshan, who explained what had happened to Shadya and his mission to bring her back. Akshan then departed to hunt down another warlord. The two Sentinels followed Akshan to the warlord's compound and watched the Absolver in action. After dispatching the warlord, the trio raced back to the base to see if Shadya was resurrected. When they find her body still lifeless, Lucian tries to recruiting him, but Akshan remains undeterred, and leaves to face another warlord.
As the two Sentinels prepare to return to headquarters, they notice that
Viego
is in the town below, searching for another fetter. As they confront the Ruined King, he unleashes an army of ghouls against them, making short work of the sentinels. As they lay dying, Akshan returns, having had a change of heart, and quickly dispatches the ghouls and takes their bodies back to the base. The two reawaken, realizing they were revived by the Absolver. Finally understanding Shadya's life goal was the sentinel's cause, Akshan finally agrees to join them and returns to Sentinel headquarters.
Senna
scolds Lucian and the Rookie for leaving in the middle of night for a secret a mission and at Akshan for his dress code violations.
Akshan joins the rest the Sentinels and
Gwen
as they mount their final assault against Viego on the Shadow Isles. As Senna draws out Viego, the Sentinels ambush him. Viego quickly turns the tide of the battle and quickly dispatches Senna and Gwen and creates a portal to Camavor and takes the fetters through. Akshan manages to slip through the portal as well and tries to take Viego out with the Absolver, but soon realizes his weapon is ineffective against the Ruined King. However, he is prompted by the recently revived Queen Isolde to shoot her instead, and he fires at the queen, returning her to eternal rest once again. With Isolde gone, Viego begins to weaken and Senna and Gwen are brought back to life. With their combined efforts, they manage to defeat the Ruined King and imprison him with Hallowed Mist.
They return to the Shadow Isles and reunite with their allies until they sense another dark presence approaching.
Thresh
arrives and reveals that he is now unbound from the Shadow Isles. He demands one of their souls in exchange for Senna's escaping, or all of their souls if none comply. The Sentinels try to resist him, but he proves too powerful. The Rookie offers their soul to Thresh instead, but as he prepares to harvest soul, the Rookie unleashes their wayfinder and teleports everyone back to headquarters instead. With Viego defeated, Akshan decides to return to Shurima and continue to honor Shadya's legacy.
After returning to Shurima, Akshan begins to forget his mentor and tries to find mementos to keep her memory alive. One day he recognizes a peculiar bracelet on the arm of a street urchin, realizing it once belonged to Shadya, he interrogates the child. The young girl reveals that she stole it from one of the warlords, determined to reclaim his master's lost jewelry, Akshan prepares to confront the warlord. Later that night, Akshan sneaks into the warlord's palace and holds him at gunpoint, demanding a confession. The sentinel orders the warlord to admit that he killed Shadya, after finding the rest of her jewelry in his possession, but he refutes the claim and asks what he really wants instead. Taking a second to ponder the question, Akshan realizes he wants peace and executes the warlord.
As Akshan walks back to city, his memories of Shadya continue to fade. He knows that she would not have approved of him killing the warlord out of vengeance, but he had done it for himself, yet it did not grant him the peace he desired. Looking towards the bracelets for solace, he notices an inscription on one of them, an old sentinel mantra:
"Give all, and all may live."
The sentinel suddenly has an epiphany and fires his grappling hook, he swings from building to building until he finds his target, the urchin from yesterday. He finds the young girl sleeping in an alley and wakes her, he then offers her Shadya's remaining bracelets, knowing it is what she would have wanted. Despite parting with the last remnants of his mentor, he now has the peace he was looking for, knowing Shadya would approve.

Absolver:
Akshan wields the Absolver; a legendary weapon of the
Sentinels of Light
that has been enchanted with the ability to
revive
the dead. The exact method of the Absolver's reviving magic isn't entirely known, but it has been shown to take the life of a killer and restore the lives of their most recent victims. Due to being an invention of the Sentinels, the Absolver is created with their signature relic stones and is capable of harming the undead

. Though initially wielded by Shadya, Akshan has taken up the Absolver and made various modifications to it.
Boomerang Proficiency:
Akshan has modified the Absolver to include a boomerang attachment, which he can easily detach and throw at long distances before returning to his hand.
Grapple Hook Proficiency:
Akshan's absolver has been modified to include a grapple hook, allowing him to travel far distances by firing it and swinging from the attached rope.
Rogue Combat Mastery:
Akshan has a particularly informal style of combat as a rogue vigilante, utilizing stealth and cunning in combat. This is due to having grown up on the streets as a child as well as his lack of formal training within the Sentinels of Light, aside from his mentor Shadya.
