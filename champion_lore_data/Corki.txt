A Bandle Scout Mission Journal

Corki is one of
Bandle City's
most decorated aeronauts, renowned for his spectacle and daredevilry when taking to the skies. When
Teemo
needed a lift to
Piltover
and
Zaun
for a Bandle Scout badge, Corki was the first
yordle
he came to for a ride. Teemo found the conversation with Corki exhausting, but it was worth it since Teemo successfully collected his badge.
Another time, when a Piltovan inventor went to unveil the world's fastest flying machine for Progress Day, Corki went there as fast as he could to challenge the device in his copter. He did not take the necessary precautions, however, and ended up crashing into the
hextech
glider in mid-air. Corki's copter survived the crash and was relatively unharmed, while the glider did not, as it was built for speed instead of sturdiness.

Don't Mess With Yordles

When word reached Bandle City of the Bandle Scout
Teemo's
disappearance,
Tristana
began making plans to set out to look for him. Corki and
Lulu
both wanted to help with the search, but Tristana refused their help, wanting to go at it alone. When they insisted, she kept them preoccupied with menial tasks, with Corki being sent to scout above
Piltover
to find a "bogey". When Corki eventually returned to find Lulu guarding a rock, he realized Tristana had tricked them and decided to follow her trail.
Corki and Lulu found Tristana and Teemo in
Bilgewater
trapped in a runic iron cage by
Malcolm Graves
, who was hoping to sell them for a fortune. They formulated a rescue plan, with Corki charging in full steam ahead and crashing his plane before he too landed into the cage. This distracted Graves long enough for Lulu to
hugify
herself, carrying the giant rock over while arguing with Tristana. Touching the runic iron caused Lulu to shrink back to normal size, dropping the rock on Graves' foot and causing him to accidentally shoot the cage and free all the other yordles, including Corki.
Graves, hoping to retake control of the situation, began to fight Corki and recaptured him with ease. Lulu saved Corki again by
transforming
Graves into a small
gromp
, who was then carried away by
Twisted Fate
. Corki and his friends then returned to Bandle City as Teemo showed them his new pet: a soul-devouring sea worm named Fluffy.

Corki is a quirky character, being obsessed with mechanical flight and seeming to view all other topics through that lens. He is an energetic but eccentric presence, almost single-mindedly devoted to his craft.

Yordle Physiology:
Corki is a
yordle
, a being coming from the
Spirit Realm
and possesses several abilities natural of his species.
Immortality:
Being spiritual beings, yordles don't age the same way as normal humans, and they can't normally die.
Yordle Magic:
Just like any yordle, Corki is capable of performing yordle magic, which he utilizes in tandem with his skills as a pilot.

Bandle Scouts

Corki is quite fond of the Bandle Scouts, describing them as young "rascals" with an "adventurer's moxy." Thinking about their adventures makes him shed tears of joy.

Teemo
[

Corki is friends with Teemo and was enthusiastic about joining a
Tristana's
mission to go rescue him. He also expressed concern about Teemo's pet soul-devouring sea worm, which he "adopted" in
Bilgewater
. Teemo admires Corki's skills as a pilot, and Corki is always happy to help Teemo whenever it's requested. However, he is known to ramble in such a long-winded manner that Teemo finds him exhausting, and would consider jumping off of Corki's copter.

Tristana

Corki is friends with Tristana. He enjoys joining her on missions, and is eager to convince her that he's not "washed up" like she thinks he is. Tristana appears generally annoyed with his cavalier behavior, but appreciates his help.

Lulu
[

]

Corki is friends with Lulu, and finds common ground with her when they both realize Tristana has been distracting them with menial tasks. They formulated a plan together to rescue both
Tristana
and
Teemo
from
Bilgewater
, which involved Corki simply charging in on his copter as a "distraction" for Lulu.

Malcolm Graves
and
Twisted Fate
[

Corki is hostile towards Graves, as he was the one responsible for capturing his friends
Teemo
and
Tristana
. He does not seem to be afraid of Graves and tried to fight him, while seemingly unaware of their disparity in size. Corki appeared indifferent to Twisted Fate, who discouraged Graves from capturing the yordles to begin with.
