Early life
[

edit source
]

Jhin is assumed to have spent most of his life into early 20's on the
Ionian
province of
Zhyun
. Not much is known about his family life, except for his father's martial arts school. His father's career was snuffed out by the success of
Wuju
.
Jhin had been slaughtering farmsteads and scores of travelers for an unknown period of time before he was persued by
Master Kusho
,
Usan
, and
Shen
. He began his work in the ages spanning from 19-21, working primarily with knives. For a little more than four years, the three men pursued Jhin and were far from the first to have hunted him down. In the final stages of the three men's investigation, they discover that he is a mere stagehand working for
Zhyun
's traveling theatre and opera houses under the name, "Khada Jhin". This is not his real name, the real one remains a mystery.

Events leading to imprisonment
[

]

Master Kusho, Zed, and Shen followed Jhin's movements to
Jyom Pass
on the
Ghajan
river.  Zed chased Jhin down only to get knocked out by the handle of his blade. Jhin captured the young acolyte and tied him to a chair looking out towards the dock. Before Zed wakes up, Jhin takes the amulet off his neck. Zed wakes up to Jhin chiding him to look up, saying that he'll want to see Yevnai before she dies.  Jhin goes on about how boring and symmetrycal Yevnai's face is in contrast to the situation which was "glorious" . Zed begins to cry at seeing Yevnai on the dock before her "final moments".  After Jhin goes on about the tragic connections between Yevnai, Shen and Usan, the captive Zed begs for Jhin to not harm her, admitting that they were following him and noting that Yevnai, "didn't do anything". After saying he'll do anything, Jhin asks about the amulet that he took from Zed. Zed then concedes that it is a symbol of the
Kinkou
and that the amulet allows them to find him. Shen, presumably having found Zed, punches through the wall and pins Jhin's neck to the wall. Zed declares that the whole thing was a set-up, that he was the bait, and takes Jhin's 4th knife, lunging at the man to kill him. Master Kusho appears in the nick of time, saving Khada Jhin's life.

Kusho believes that because Jhin is not a real
demon
, he should be locked away at the monestary prison in
Tuula
.
Khada Jhin was sentenced to life in the Tuula monestary prison. Jhin revealed as little about himself as possible during his many years there. The monks that guarded him said he was a "bright student". He excelled at a myriad of subjects, mostly in the arts, (i.e. smithing, poetry, and dance). Despite this, they could find nothing to cure him of his morbid fascinations. During his time in jail, the Noxian invasion began, and it is due to Ionia's instability during this time that his patrons funded him and released him from jail to terrorize the citizens of Ionia into action.

Release from Prison
[

Jhin, post-Tuula, is freely roaming, bound only by his patrons. Those weaponizing Jhin include: the
Kashuri
Armories, as their weapons are relatively moderized for Ionia. Supposedly Jhin has also done performances for the
Navori Brotherhood
,
Noxus
, and most recently
Zaun
. Zed, when faced with Jhin's sniper rifle for the first time remarked that it was a "foreigners weapon". He has been described at this point in his life as both an assassin and an instrument of terror.

Post-Imprisonment
[

edit source
]

Jhin was released some time after the war with Noxus. The timeline of his actions right after his release from prison is unclear, but he eventually sends a messenger out to
Zed
. She, the messenger, rows a small boat (with one of Jhin's lanterns on it!) out to the
Kwol Tavern
where she finds Master Zed and delivers him a message about a "rich man" wanting to meet him in the village north of the
Thonx outskirts
; she gives Zed a blade attuned to his spirit wrapped in a red cloth which was the "rich man's" supposed thank-you-gift.

Jhin kills four people before the Order of Shadow arrive: two unidentified people, the messenger, and the woman whose leg was amputated by Zed and Kusho 16 years prior. This time span makes Jhin about 38 to 39 years old currently.

Appearance
[

edit source
]

Jhin is a tall, slender, pale-skinned man. He has black hair and brown eyes (he is seen only using one, however his eyes are perfectly fine, he covers one because he enjoys the lack of depth during his "performances").
His most noticeable feature is his theater mask that he wears constantly when performing as Khada Jhin. It is implied that he has an average face that allows him to easily blend in when in a crowd. Typically, he wears a large white cloak  as well as elegant Ionian attire. He refers to his attire as his "finery" and at times uses the middle half of his gun as a cane to announce his presence and to rhythmically tap on the ground.

Personality
[

edit source
]

Despite his theatrics during murders, much of his day-to-day personality is reserved and quiet; it's not very memorable which he takes advantage of with his performances. Within the ranks of the
Navori Brotherhood
, the few that know him consider him a weirdo.
[

]
His inner voice is one of attentiveness, almost to the point of obsession, like when he cleans the stock of his gun. When interacting with the people around him, he seems to analyze their attributes. The man is internally self-deprecating, as it is mentioned that "normally, [his appearance] elicited pangs of self-conscious loathing". When it comes to his performances, he's willing to take risks which makes sense due to his psychopathy. He's also notably grandiose, carrying himself with an air of haughtiness.

Akali tracked Jhin down to
Piltover
-
Zaun
and was captured by him, but was later saved with the help of
Shen
and
Zed
.

Hwei
[

edit source
]

Even with their creative differences, the virtuoso could recognize that Hwei had been reluctant to push his own artistic potential in front of others. Jhin then encouraged the man to challenge himself, enabling Hwei to unleash decades of suppressed emotions within his art.

Kusho
[

]

As the main reason for his imprisonment, Jhin holds some resentment towards the
Kinkou
master. However, after Kusho fakes his death with the help of Zed and becoming the leader of the
Navori Brotherhood
, Kusho unleashed Jhin to terrorize and get control of
Ionia
. Jhin knows the truth about the circumstance of Kusho's "death" and could have revealed to Shen if he had wanted to but didn't as he realized Zed was going after Kusho.

Shen
&
Zed
[

edit source
]

Jhin has some resentment towards Shen and Zed for catching him and imprisoning him. During each of his encounters with both Shen and Zed, he would leave a trail of gruesome deaths behind him, which would forever change the two ninjas. After he was released, Jhin would force Zed and Shen to work together so he might kill them both for catching him years before. He attacked Zed, Kayn and their
order
, killing some of the members.

Sona
[

Jhin has some interest in killing Sona for being a very famous
Ionian
artist who is taking the spotlight away from his 'performances'.
