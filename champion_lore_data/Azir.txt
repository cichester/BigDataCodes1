Early life

Azir was the last son of the emperor of Shurima. He never received the same love from the emperor as did the other children. It was highly unexpected that he would be the one to become emperor. He spent most of his time studying the texts rather than training for combat.
Azir met a slave looking for texts for his master in the library. Surprisingly, he was able to help Azir understand complex grammar from an ancient text. The two quickly became friends after this, and Azir named the boy Xerath, even though slaves were not allowed names.
One day, while the royal family was travelling in the desert, they were attacked by assassins. Azir and Xerath had gone out to plot the stars. Xerath managed to suppress the attacker while Azir plunged a dagger into his throat. But Azir’s brothers had all been killed before Renekton managed to slay the assassins. Azir promised that one day, he and Xerath would be brothers.
Azir, now heir to the throne, began to train in combat under the tutelage of Renekton. He learned to wield the sword and spear.
Strangely, all the sons of the emperor’s wife began to die before they were born. Then one was finally born. But during a great storm, the emperor’s wife was killed along with her newborn son. It was said that the emperor went mad with grief and took his own life, leaving Azir to take the throne.

The Catastrophic Ascension
[

Xerath had secretly longed for the power of ascension himself and saw Azir as a threat to his own aspirations; a world without slavery, and to end that, he secretly planned to guide Azir to the Dais of Ascension himself. On the day of Ascension, just as Azir is ascended-Xerath used his magic to subvert the ritual, causing it to fail and unleashing a catastrophic explosion that destroyed the capital city of Shurima, killing many of Azir's people in the process.
In the aftermath of the failed ascension, Azir was presumed dead, and Shurima fell into ruin and decay. However, Azir had actually ascended in a flawed and incomplete manner, becoming trapped in a state of suspended animation, his body and spirit separated from each other. Over the centuries, Azir's spirit remained dormant, while his body was preserved in a state of stasis within a chamber in The Sun Disc, an ancient structure that had been built to harness the power of the sun and the magic of the Ascended. It wasn't until the present day, when
The Sun Disc
was rediscovered and reactivated, that Azir's body was reawakened, and his spirit was reunited with it. When the tomb containing the Sun Disc and Azir was opened, chaos broke out and
Sivir
's blood spilled over to the sand, awakening the falcon god in the process.
As Azir awakened, he was confronted by the brutal reality of his empire's decline and the treachery of those who had sought to undermine him, especially the now berserk
Xerath
. Despite these obstacles, Azir remained determined to reclaim his throne and rebuild Shurima, using his newfound power and knowledge to unite his people and restore their former glory.

Appearance

Azir is a tall male humanoid figure with features of a bird, specifically a falcon, his head is that of a golden falcon with blue eyes that shine like sapphires. He wears ancient golden Shuriman armor with red ribbons hanging from his arms and a white cape on his back.
When he was human, Azir was a brown-skinned man and quite stocky, with long dark hair tied in dreadlocks and various trappings of royalty.He didn't wear a shirt but his chest and arms were adorned with all kinds of Shuriman amulets and necklaces, he wore white baggy pants with red ribbons around his hips.

Personality
[

Azir is a proud, determined ruler who sees potential in others. While he originally had no chance of being emperor, he befriended Xerath and saw him more than just a mere slave, but also a friend and even a brother. He wished to repay Xerath by giving him rewards and a higher status, but the societal values of Shurima prevented this. Despite this, Azir wished to become emperor to abolish slavery and give Xerath what he would've wanted, but his power led to him becoming hubristic, which was Azir's biggest weakness and one of the causes of Shurima's downfall. While he did have selfless intentions for the empire, his arrogance prevented him from communicating his goals with Xerath and seeing when he was being manipulated, and his shortsightedness towards the consequences of his actions caused Xerath's resentment to grow to the point where by the time he announced his plan, it was too late and Xerath had already made his decision to betray him.
Since his resurrection, Azir now wishes to rebuild the empire and return Shurima to its former glory is a very noble gesture, calling upon the help of his allies in order to do so.
However Azir has shown a quite noble and generous side, since one of the things he always wanted to do after becoming emperor was to abolish slavery and help the poor, he has shown a kinder side of him when he saved Sivir's life.

Abilities

Ascended:
Azir is an Ascended, also known as God-Warriors or Sunborn. The Ascended are mortals that were empowered by The Sun Disc into immensely powerful demigods. Each Ascended has unique powers depending on the individual they were prior to the Ascension.
Immortality:
The ascended do not age, and do not need to eat or sleep. Barring beings of similar power, the Ascended cannot be killed.
Sand Magic:
Azir can control the sands of the Shuriman desert to his desires, creating almost anything that he desires, like massive building and cities around him.
Sand Soldiers:
Azir mainly uses his power over the sand to create his mighty Sand Soldiers, powerful constructs that serve as his personal army. The Sand Soldiers are completely under his control, are far more powerful than a normal human and don't need neither sleep nor food.

Xerath
[

]

Xerath's
treachery made Azir furious at his former soul brother betraying his trust to become an Ascended being and destroying Shurima in the process. He can't let go because he truly loved his nation, however much his ambition may have led him astray. He can't accept responsibility for what happened to his kingdom - he blames Xerath, but was it really Xerath's fault...? Or was it the emperor who couldn't see the cruel intent of his most trusted advisor - and friend? And yes - for the moment, he is an emperor without an empire. An emperor without a people. He has nothing - but he'll do everything with his newfound power to change that, and rebuild Shurima into the thriving, powerful empire it once was.

Ezreal

Given
Ezreal's
exploration of the Shurima Desert and robbing of artifacts from its tombs, it's likely Azir won't be entirely fond of him.

Sivir
[

]

Azir dislikes
Sivir's
graverobbing but does not resent her. She is family after all, and saving her from
Cassiopeia's
backstabbing meant everything at the time of his revival. He would hold his hatred for Cassiopeia for almost ending his bloodline forever.

Nasus
&
Renekton
[

]

When he was young, Azir was taught ancient knowledge from
Nasus
and combat from
Renekton
. The Ascended brothers' teachings will prove useful for the trials ahead.
Azir is disappointed that a mighty warrior such as
Renekton
has been reduced to a rabid beast after being tortured beyond insanity for imprisoning himself with Xerath.
On the other hand,
Nasus
might be the only remaining Ascended that can help the Emperor. Azir deeply respects Nasus, though the Curator looks down on him for his arrogance and for what his hubris did to Shurima.
