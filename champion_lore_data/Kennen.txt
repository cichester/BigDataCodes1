Ancient Times

Unlike many of his kind, Kennen felt a dissonance within the vibrant chaos of his homeland,
Bandle City
. Seeking harmony and balance, Kennen ventured forth from the spirit realm millennia ago, drawn by an insatiable curiosity that led him to traverse the material realm.
His journey eventually brought him to the serene
First Lands
, where
ancient wars that none now remember
had scarred the landscape, leaving behind a people striving to rebuild amidst the echoes of conflict. Kennen found solace among the inhabitants of the
First Lands
, fascinated by their relentless pursuit of balance and tranquility. Over time, he became deeply woven into the fabric of First Lands, forsaking his ties to Bandle City as he embraced the mortal realm and its inhabitants.

Acceptance into the Kinkou

As Kennen delved deeper into the affairs of the First Lands, now known as
Ionia
, he encountered malevolent entities from the spirit realm threatening the delicate equilibrium of the land. Alone, he valiantly battled these disturbances, but soon realized that mere combat was not enough to address the root cause of imbalance. It was then that he discovered the
Kinkou
, a fledgling order dedicated to preserving harmony between the realms.
Recognizing the need for a unifying force within the order, Kennen proposed himself as an arbiter, a bridge between the introspective Eye of Twilight and the warlike Fist of Shadow. With his affability and diplomacy, he became the Kinkou's first Heart of the Tempest, working alongside the Eye and the Fist to pass judgment and maintain equilibrium.

Noxian Invasion of Ionia

In the tumultuous aftermath of the Noxian invasion, as Ionia teetered on the brink of collapse, the Kinkou found themselves torn apart by internal strife and external threats. Despite Kennen's efforts to guide the order through the chaos, the shadow of betrayal loomed large as
Zed
, a former acolyte, orchestrated a coup.
In the darkest hour of the Kinkou, Kennen stood steadfast, offering counsel to the new Eye of Twilight,
Shen
, as he grappled with the burdens of leadership. He urged the Fist of Shadow, Mayym, to recognize
Akali
, his protege, as a potential successor. Yet even his wisdom could not prevent Akali's eventual departure from the order, disillusioned by its perceived failure to confront Ionia's enemies.

Discharging the Raishai Acolytes

Kennen receives an urgent plea for help from the acolytes of the
Temple of Raishai
, on the southern coast of
Zhyun
, whose temple has been corrupted by an
unknown malevolent force
. As he races through varied landscapes, Kennen reflects on the weight of this mission, especially since it involves saving his fellow Kinkou members.
Arriving at the temple, Kennen discovers that the corruption lies not in the physical structure but within the acolytes themselves. They have become vessels for dark entities, fueled by their anguish and despair over the Kinkou's past decisions of non-intervention during times of conflict. Despite their loyalty to the order, their unresolved emotions have allowed these malevolent forces to take hold.
In a poignant moment, Kennen confronts the acolytes, gently revealing the truth of their condition and offering them a path to healing by releasing them from their Kinkou duties. However, some of the acolytes resist, seeing this as a dishonorable act and challenging Kennen. Using his lightning powers, Kennen incapacitates those who resist, not with the intent to harm but to break through their defenses and help them understand the necessity of leaving the order for their own well-being. Through his actions, Kennen not only dispels the immediate threat but also offers the acolytes a chance to find peace and balance once more.
As the former acolytes depart, Kennen reflects on the bittersweet nature of their departure, knowing that it was necessary for their own good and the greater harmony of the world. Despite the sorrow of parting ways, Kennen is resolved to carry their story forward, honoring their sacrifice and ensuring that their struggles are not forgotten.
