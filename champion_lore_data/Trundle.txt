Early Life
[

edit source
]

Trundle was born in a cave in the
Freljord
with fifteen brothers and sisters, most of whom died due to the harsh climate and scarce resources in their home. When he grew strong enough, he joined his chieftain's warband for his very first winter of raiding. After numerous victories, the tribe feasted on the spoils, and the old chieftain declared they should circle back and raid the same lands again, as it would be easier the second time. Trundle, however, believed this was a bad idea, as these lands had nothing left for them to pillage. The other
trolls
did not understand Trundle's reasoning, and the chieftain beat and exiled Trundle from their warband for being a "coward" and a "fool." Having been cast out of his own tribe, Trundle traveled far from his home, avoiding other troll tribes and feral
yetis
as he survived the harsh conditions.

Alliance with Lissandra

After some time wandering on his own, Trundle stumbled upon the
Howling Abyss
where he met
Lissandra
on a dark, frozen lake in the labyrinth under her citadel. Since Trundle was still alive after standing on
True Ice
, Lissandra realized he was an
Iceborn
and offered Trundle a home as one of her
Frostguard
. However, Trundle explained that the only thing he desired as a powerful weapon, which he could use to return to his tribe and become a mighty troll king like Grubgrack the Wise from the ancient legends. After hearing Trundle's story, Lissandra offered to help Trundle in exchange for an alliance, giving him a club of True Ice called
Boneshiver
, which he could use to return to his people and become the king of all trolls.
When Trundle returned home to his tribe, he killed the old chieftain with his club, freezing him solid with its magic and then shattering him into a million pieces. Trundle told the other trolls about his new alliance with the Ice Witch, and impressed that he had been chosen to wield great power, they made Trundle their new king.

A Feast Fit for a King

Some time after Trundle declared himself "king of all trolls," another troll in the far north, Yettu, decided he wanted to be a king as well. Few began to oppose Yettu's rule after he killed the northern chieftains, and Trundle, angered that another troll was copying him, went to go speak with Yettu in his cave. To decide who would be the one true king, Trundle challenged Yettu to a battle of wits, where they would both eat copious amounts of food until the other one dropped dead. During their feast, Trundle secretly stuffed some of his uneaten food in a leather sack beneath his cloak. When they were both feeling full, Trundle pretended to "make room" in his stomach by cutting his cloak and letting the meat fall onto the floor. Yettu copied Trundle's trick and used the knife to cut open his own stomach, killing himself. Having bested his rival, Trundle was recognized as the true king of the trolls.

Welcome to Noxus

During one of the
Noxian
campaigns to the Freljord,
Darius
and his soldiers attempted to pass through lands that were guarded by Trundle and his trolls. The two leaders fought, and although Trundle physically overpowered Darius and stripped off most of his armor, Darius managed to knock him unconscious using his battle axe, which had been frozen by Boneshiver. Trundle was carried away by his warriors, and Darius survived after suffering freezing damage to his arm.

Appearance

edit source
]

Trundle is a hulking behemoth of a troll, appearing to humans as a giant. He has rugged, light blue skin, glowing blue eyes, and a flare of swept-back red hair. He also has a medium-length beard with no mustache. Like other trolls, he has three digits on each limb, pointed ears, and several upward-pointing tusks on his lower jaw.
He usually wears simple, tribal attire: a loin cloth strapped to a shoulder pad and bracers on his forearms and shins. His clothes are brown leather and lined with pale fur, sometimes decorated with red cloth or blue metal plates. Trundle's club, Boneshiver, is a massive cudgel of jagged, blunt
True Ice
. In the far north, Trundle has been known to wear a patchwork fur cloak to shield him from the cold. After Trundle's feast with his rival, Yettu, he learned what a crown looked like and began wearing one made of dark iron on his forehead.
