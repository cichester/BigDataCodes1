Early life

Vex was born and raised in
Bandle City
, and despite her parents' best efforts, Vex never felt like she belonged. She disliked the city's bright colors and she could never really find her "yordle spirit" or any like-minded friends. She spent most of her time sulking in her room, spending time with her shadow, which she liked because it was dark and never said anything.

Journey to the Shadow Isles

Eventually, the Black Mist came to Bandle City. While the other residents of the city fought back against the Mist, Vex was intrgued by it and followed it to its source, the
Shadow Isles
. Vex loved it, as it was dark, gloomy, and full of dead spirits, which she liked. As she stayed there longer, she noticed that a combination of the Black Mist and her passive yordle magic allowed her
Shadow
to gain sentience and also changed her magic, allowing her to cast gloomy and dark spells.
After a time, Vex met
Viego
, making an alliance with him to plunge the world into darkness and gloom. However, soon Vex found out of Viego's real goal: bringing his
dead wife
back to life. Disgusted by this show of love, Vex left Viego's side to go back to the Bandle City to tell her parents of all she had done and bask in their disapproval. But when her parents told her that they loved her unconditionally, Vex just sighed, told her parents that they were the worst, and left for the Isles once more.
