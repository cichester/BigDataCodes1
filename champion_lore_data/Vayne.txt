Early Life
[

Shauna Vayne was born to House Vayne, a wealthy, noble family in
Demacia
. She experienced a privileged childhood, being able to enjoy solitary pursuits such as reading, learning music, and collecting insects. Shortly after her sixteenth birthday, Vayne would return to home to find her parents dead, killed by a horned
demon
. The people of Demacia found it inconceivable that a demon would be able to slip past their defenses and murder her parents, but Vayne knew better. Driven by her parent's death, Vayne would seek out a mentor, someone who could teach her how to combat the forces of darkness.
She would travel to the
Freljord
to search for her teacher, learning of the Iceborn warriors who battled the
Ice Witch
from the stories her parents used to tell her. While traversing the frozen tundra, Vayne would be trapped by a ravenous ice troll. As the troll prepared to consume the young aristocrat, he would fall dead to spear of a grizzled, middle-aged woman. She introduced herself as Frey and bandaged Vayne's wounds. Frey explained that she dedicated her life to fighting the Ice Witch's forces, after they killed her children, and Vayne implored her to take her on as a student. Determining that an aristocrat wouldn't have the resolve to fight against the forces of darkness, she refused, but Vayne would not take no for answer. Vayne challenged the Freljordian to a duel, if she won, Frey would have to train her, but if she lost, she would offer herself as bait for the Ice Queen's minions. Seeing Vayne's determination, Frey would agree to train her and the two would return to Demacia.
Vayne would spend the next several years training and hunting with Frey, growing closer with her mentor and eventually seeing her as a maternal figure. However, she was suspicious as to how her teacher had such an in depth understanding of dark magics. They would frequently travel outside of Demacia to hunt their prey and tales of their valor would spread across Valoran. One day they would catch rumor of the horned demon that had slayed Vayne's parents, she had established a cult designed to do her bidding and lure more victims. As they tracked the demon to her lair, Vayne felt fear that she would lose her mother figure again. Before she could express her concerns, they would be ambushed by one of the cultists, injuring Vayne. In order to protect her, Frey transformed into a Freljordian wolf and tore the priest's throat with a single bite. Frey quickly returned to her human form and tried to explain that she became a shaman to combat the Ice Witch, but Vayne fired a bolt through her heart and any affection she felt died with her. Vayne now resumes her hunt for the demon that killed her parents as well as any other monsters that prey upon Runeterra.

Vayne would take a job from a woman in Demacia, her husband had become a monster that attacked the countryside. After tracking him down, she would put him out of his misery and take his body back to his wife. Vayne confronted the woman, revealing that she knows that she is a therian and transformed her husband in an attempt to devour him. Vayne swiftly dispatched the shapechanger and avenged the man.

Rise of the Sentinels

Vayne was present at the Great City of Demacia when
Viego
unleashed Harrowings across Runeterra. She helped repel the army of wraiths alongside
Poppy
and discovered a mysterious crest belonging to the
Sentinels of Light
. A few weeks later, Demacia would be sieged by another Harrowing. Vayne took shelter in the Singing Swan Tavern and encountered
Gwen
,
Lucian
,
Senna
, and a Sentinel Rookie seeking more information about the origin of the Harrowing. The Sentinels discovered that the Harrowing was focused around the Mageseeker Compound and Vayne accompanied them to the epicenter of the attack. At the entrance, they would be met by
Shyvana
, afflicted by the Black Mist, and the half-dragon would attempt to bury them beneath rubble. The group frees themselves and venture further into the compound, Viego secures the artifact guarded by the mageseekers and they give chase to the Ruined King. As they corner him,
Shyvana
returns and attacks, transforming into a Ruined Dragon at Vayne's provocation. They eventually manage to best Shyvana, but Viego escapes with the artifact. As Vayne prepares to execute Shyvana, Senna convinces her not to, and they agree to lock her up in the mageseeker dungeon. Seeing how ineffective her silver weapons were against the Black Mist, Vayne offers to join the Sentinels, in exchange for Relic weapons. They return to headquarters and Vayne is sworn into their ranks and outfitted with a new uniform and a relic crossbow.
Vayne accompanies the Sentinels as they race across Runeterra, trying to stop Viego from securing more fetters. Along the way, the Sentinels would recruit
Malcom Graves
, Vayne's no-nonsense attitude would garner Graves' respect and, to Vayne's dismay, friendship. Eventually the Sentinels of Light would prepare their final stand against Viego on the
Shadow Isles
. Vayne and the other Sentinels battled
Karma
,
Miss Fortune
,
Pantheon
,
Shyvana
and their army of wraiths, while
Akshan
,
Gwen
,
Senna
and the Rookie would defeat Viego in Camavor. With the Ruined King defeated, most of the Sentinels opted to return to their old lives, but Vayne agreed to take up their post in Demacia, while Lucian and Senna hunt
Thresh
, recently unbound from the Shadow Isles.
