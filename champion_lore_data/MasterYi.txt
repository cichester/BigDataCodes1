Early Life

Yi was born in the village of Wuju in the province of Bahrl in Ionia. His parents were swordsmiths and he longed to learn the ways of the sword after seeing warriors who carried blades with poems to their names enter his parents’ workshop. He spent the mornings sparring with his mother and his nights reciting poetry with his father.
Soon, he began to train under the Wuju masters. He surpassed all expectations and became known as the “Young Master” Yi. But he was always curious about the rest of Ionia. However, he was forbidden to leave the village with his blade because the Wuju sought to keep their swordsmanship a secret and believed it was too precious to draw blood.
This all changed when Noxus invaded. Yi decided to forego the Wuju traditions in order to defend his homeland. He was like a one-man army, sweeping the outsiders with blinding swordplay. He then journeyed with some of his fellow disciples to Navori, a critical location in the war.
The Noxians identified the Wuju as a threat that they could not ignore and used chemical attacks to destroy the village of Wuju. Yi returned the only surviving disciple, slain in spirit when he learned of what had happened to his home village.
