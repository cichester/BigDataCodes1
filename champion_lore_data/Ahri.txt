Ahri's earliest memories are of her growing up among a pack of icefoxes in northern
Shon-Xan
. Though her true origins are unknown even to her, she was accepted by the pack and considered one of them. Though she was a
vastaya
, she had no knowledge of her tribe except for a pair of sunstones she carried her entire life.
Living in the wild among the icefoxes, Ahri began to feel her vastayan abilities surface as she found she was capable of channeling the
Spirit Realm
within herself, gaining the ability to enhance her in reflexes and control the emotions of her prey.
Ahri often watched humans from afar for years until she found one wounded by a stray arrow. Ahri found she could feel his life force seeping away and followed her predatorial instincts, absorbing his spiritual essence and feasting on his memories, emotions and knowledge on human language. As she grew closer to the fringes of
Ionian
society, Ahri became addicted to feeding off of the spiritual essence of mortals, becoming drunk on their emotions and stolen memories. Eventually Ahri saw memories depicting how humans perceived her; a terrifying monster. Distressed by this, Ahri tried to stop from feeding on mortal essence but realized her powers slowly faded if she did, deciding to fully embrace her nature as a monster.
One day, Ahri met an artist who, instead of running away from her in fear, actually offered his own essence in exchange for her love. For the first time, Ahri felt genuine happiness without having to feed on spiritual essence and the two fell in love. Though Ahri pleaded that she was too monstrous for him, the artist explained that he loved her wholly despite her monstrous nature. The two would often sit by a lake at the edge of Ionia, as Ahri blissfully watched her lover paint pictures of flowers. Unfortunately, Ahri lost control of her ravenous instincts one day and completely drained her lover, killing him. Ahri despaired over this and mourned the loss of the first and only person she truly loved, retreating further even from society.

The Garden of Forgetting

Ahri attempting to forget.

Grief stricken over the loss of her lover, Ahri retreated from society and travelled to the
Garden of Forgetting
. Here, she wished to erase all the troubled memories she stole during her time as a predator, especially those of her dead lover.
Here she met a mysterious old woman tending to the garden. Ahri recognized this woman as the garden's caretaker, known by names such as the Eater of Secrets, the Forgotten or the Witch Gardener. Ahri referred to her as
Ighilya,
the Ionian word for "great grandmother," and begged her to show her how to forget the painful memories of her lover. The Gardener warned her that forgetting these memories was a worse fate, but reluctantly agreed to help Ahri, handing her a budding snow lily and instructing her to breath into the flower and think of the memory she wanted to get rid of. The flower, while trying to consume the memory, caused Ahri to relive the death of her lover through painful visions, making Ahri realize that she didn't want to lose these memories of her beloved as removing them was far worse than living with the pain.
Attempting to pull away, Ahri felt suffocated by the unnatural perfumes of the snow lily and saw hallucinogenic visions appear as a result of it. After hallucinating in the garden, she regained her senses as the Gardener stood above her, asking her if she managed to keep the memory before the flower took hold. Ahri explained that she did, despite it seeming cloudy, as the Gardener quietly urged Ahri to leave the garden before it takes her, as it did with many others who visited it before. As dark vines and snow lilies began to overgrow and cover the exits out of the garden, Ahri managed to escape with her vastayan reflexes and decided that she would from now on live from her past pains and experiences rather than regret and attempt to forget them.

Himon'she
in
Omikayalan
.

Wishing to find a solution to control her abilities and her predatory instincts, Ahri became consumed with learning more about her origins and her mysterious vastayan tribe. Her travels through Ionia eventually lead her to
Omikayalan
, the once sacred grove of the God-Willow; a legendary and magical tree that had been cut down thousands of years ago. There she met several spiritual creatures that protected
3
a God-Willow sapling
, including vastayan lords such as
4
Himon'she
,
5
Gai'sh
,
5
the Tail-Cloak Matriarch
and a mighty fox spirit named
7
Sai'nen Thousand-Tailed
. Here, Ahri learned to embrace her wild vastayan nature, continuing her search for her lost tribe and leaving the sacred grove.

Ymelo's Sunstones
[

On her search for her lost tribe, Ahri travelled to an Ionian market, taking in the new environment. A fortune teller named Hirin approached Ahri and recognized her twin sunstones as the work of a talented artisan named Ymelo. Curious, as these sunstones were her only link to her lost tribe, Ahri asked the fortune teller more details about Ymelo as the two conversed in her caravan. Offering Ahri tea, Hirin proceeded to tell Ahri what she knew about Ymelo, explaining how he was a master sculptor known for collecting fossilized lizard eggs and carving them into intricate shapes. Ahri's sunstones were a very particular beauty to Hirin, as she explained that his stones were typically built to be small pieces fitting into a larger sculpture.
As the conversation went on, Hirin pulled out a hunting knife and revealed that she slipped a paralysis potion into Ahri's tea, leaving Ahri unable to move or pounce as her limbs completely froze. Hirin sought to cut off one of Ahri's tails, as they are a useful ingredient for her potions and seen as extremely valuable.
Despite being paralyzed, Ahri managed to use her soul-devouring abilities to steal essence from Hirin and make herself strong enough to move again. Enraged, Ahri began to devour Hirin's essence, seeing flashes of her memories and witnessing the hardships she faced in life. Empathizing with the fortune teller, Ahri decided to spare her life, devouring the memories of their encounter and leaving Hirin to forget what just happened. Ahri then left the market with a new lead to follow on her quest; the craftsman Ymelo.

Spirit Blossom Festival
[

At some point, Ahri found more clues about Ymelo that required her to travel to the pirate city
Bilgewater
. In order to do so however, Ahri realized that she needed a bodyguard to escort her overseas. Travelling to
Weh'le
during a
Spirit Blossom
festival, Ahri found her self at a local teahouse in search of anybody willing to act as her protecting in Bilgewater.
Overhearing a conversation about
Noxian
warriors living in the village, Ahri became curious and asked where she can find a mighty warrior like these Noxians to serve as her guard. Paskoma, the teahouse's owner, immediately denied Ahri and refused to allow anybody dangerous to stay in her house, insisting that Ahri leave if she intends to bring in a warrior. Ahri didn't want to stay at a different teahouse and agreed to respect Paskoma's wishes before disappearing into her room.
During the first night of the Spirit Blossom festival, a massive feast was hosted at the teahouse as even Ahri decided to join in on the festivities. During the dinner, Ahri talked with Paskoma's granddaughter Satokka, who mistook Ahri's fox-like appearance as a costume of
the Gatekeeper
; a mythological Ionian spirit known for guiding the dead souls during the festival. The two got in a heated discussed over Ionian culture and mythology, most notably about a spirit named
the Taker
. As Paskoma's spouse Ituren began to serve dessert to the teahouse guests, Ahri used her
mind altering abilities
to convince him to let warriors in the teahouse.

At some point, Ahri met
Yasuo
; a lone swordsman in search of a purpose outside of Ionia. They both wanted to find things outside of their homeland, so Ahri managed to persuade Yasuo into accompanying her to Bilgewater, officially hiring him as her bodyguard. Though the two set sail and traveled together, Ahri kept her vastayan nature and identity a secret from Yasuo.

Arrival in Bilgewater
[
edit

edit source
]

As the two finally arrived in the pirate city, Ahri traveled to a black market and spoke to one of their vendors. Asking about her tribe, now knowing them as the
Vesani
, Ahri learned that a Vesani sunstone was recently purchased by a member of the
Jagged Hooks
named Malik, who was headed towards Grey Harbor. Overtime though, Yasuo grew more frustrated as Ahri refused to explain her mission and reveal her true nature to him. Deciding to search for the pirate tomorrow, the two stayed the night at a local tavern where Yasuo finally deduced Ahri's true nature as a vastaya as she revealed her mission to him. That night, after having a nightmare of her former lover, Ahri feared the same thing would happen to Yasuo and left for Grey Harbor alone, managing to track down and interrogate one of the Jagged Hooks. Here, she discovered that the pirate king
Gangplank
actually took the sunstone and set off for the
Shadow Isles
.

The Shadow Isles
[

edit source
]

Ahri along the rest of the crew of the Charming Lady, consisting of her bodyguard Yasuo,
Illaoi
, their captain
Sarah Fortune
,
Pyke
and
Braum
.

In pursuit of the sunstone, Ahri traveled to the Shadow Isles by herself, leaving her cloak behind in the forst. Here, she encountered and befriended the nature spirit
Maokai
, who explained his origins as a spirit that once helped the
Blessed Isles
flourish with life before the
Ruination of Helia
. Searching for Gangplank, Maokai revealed that he actually allied himself with the wicked wraith
Thresh
, using his artifacts to stir the mist and causing it to form impenetrable walls and weaken Maokai by infecting his roots within the Vesani vaults below the isles, who she discovered had traveled to the Blessed Isles long before the Ruination.
Yasuo arrived on the Shadow Isles as part of the crew of the Charming Lady, accompanied by
Braum
,
Illaoi
,
Pyke
and their captain
Sarah Fortune
. The group faced off against a threatened Maokai before Ahri intervened, clearing the air and explaining the situation that Maokai shared with her. As the crew also wanted to find Gangplank, they realized he would most likely be in Thresh's fortress which was being protected by walls of the Black Mist. Ahri planned on heading to one of the Vesani vaults in search of more evidence, but the others insisted on accompanying her to cleanse Maokai's roots to which she reluctantly agreed.

Cleansing Maokai's Roots
[
edit
|
edit source
]

The crew pushed back the Black Mist infesting the vault while Ahri slowly gained more knowledge and clues about her ancestors, discovering that they had a deep connection to the Shadow Isles and created technology based around preserving memories. Though they managed to cleanse Maokai's roots, he would regain his strength slowly and remained too weak to immediately help clear out the mist. Instead, the group planned to travel to a an undersea temple of the
Buhru
as Maokai gave Illaoi one of his seeds to be blessed by her god
Nagakabouros
, allowing him to quickly restore his grove and clear out the mist.
After Pyke managed to locate the deep undersea temple and Illaoi convinced the Buhru serpent callers to tame the sea monsters guarding it, the crew traveled into the undersea temple and found a place to purify the seed of the Black Mist and bless it. Ahri, using her powers to aid in the process, nearly lost control of herself due to the Black Mist corruption within the seed before regaining her sanity. With the seed now successfully blessed, the crew sailed back to the Shadow Isles to return it to Maokai.
On their way to Maokai's grove, the crew met an undead shade named
Necrit
, revealed to be the former advisor of
Viego
, the Ruined King of
Camavor
. Necrit explains and reveals the true, unknown origins of the Shadow Isles and how it was formed by the broken heart of Viego after the tragic death of his wife
Isolde
. Finally, Necrit warned the crew that Thresh's grand plan is to use artifacts of power to reawaken Viego from the mist before bidding them farewell and urging them to stop Thresh's ritual.

Facing Thresh
[
edit
|
edit source
]

With Maokai reinvigorated by the purified seed, he managed to clear out the walls of mist and expose Thresh's fortress, allowing the crew to enter. Inside Thresh's Library of Agony, Ahri found Thresh's collection of Vesani artifacts, as well as Gangplank's sunstone which she discovered was a vessel used to contain memories. However, the sunstone seemed depleted and drained with only some residual memories of her ancestors. Wishing to examine it more, Ahri took the sunstone for safekeeping. The crew eventually manage to find Thresh and defeat him in battle, returning him to the Black Mist.

Return of the Ruined King
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Now searching for Gangplank, the crew travelled to the heart of the Shadow Isles hoping to stop him but arrive too late, as Gangplank has already reawakened Viego. Though he attempted to capture Viego within a Buhru artifact, he fails and becomes
possessed
by the Ruined King as he flies towards Bilgewater alongside a violent
Harrowing
in search of his
dead wife's crown
. Forced to fight the crew under Viego's control, Gangplank was defeated and imprisoned on Sarah Fortune's ship. Meanwhile, Ahri managed to sense something lingering in the Black Mist and receieved visions of Viego's discarded memories, seeing the negative parts of his marriage and learning the truth; that his love for his wife was not as pure as he tells himself.

Shipwrecked
[
edit

edit source
]

In order to pursue Viego, Yasuo volunteered to channel the wind into the sails and Ahri empowered him with her own magic. While Illaoi interrogates Gangplank for a way to defeat Viego, he reveals that the discarded memories discovered by Ahri would most likely be capable of weakening Viego enough to be defeated. Though they managed to reach Viego, he sends out a gale of Black Mist, shipwrecking the crew on a mysterious island with mystical winds. Here, Yasuo became haunted by visions of his past and confronted a shadow resembling his
dead brother
. Seeing Yasuo's past play in action, Ahri began to empathize with him and shared her own grief over her dead lover, allowing him to defeat the shadow and overcome his past. The ship is eventually repaired, allowing them to make it back to Bilgewater in time to prepare them for Viego's Harrowing.

The Vesani Vault
[
edit
|
edit source
]

The crew make a plan to have Ahri weaken Viego with his own discarded memories and imprison him within Gangplank's Buhru amulet, but it had been corrupted and damaged in the fight. Learning about an ancient Buhru forge located underneath the Shadow Isles, the crew plan to take the amulet there to have it repaired. Once they land at the Shadow Isles, they are once again confronted by Necrit, who revealed that the forge is located inside a Vesani vault with more evidence of Ahri's ancestors. Inside the vault, Ahri channeled the memories within her twin sunstones and learned that her people were a nomadic tribe of vastaya that specialized in studying magic relating to memories. Their nomadic lifestyle brought them to the Blessed Isles, where they became allies with the city of Helia and began to study the ethereal Hallowed Mist that once protected the isles, learning to harness its power to enchant golems, technologies and other artifacts such as Ahri's sunstones. The Vesani however became victims of the terrible
Ruination of Helia
that ultimately created the Shadow Isles.
After finding a facility capable of transferring memories into sunstones, Ahri planned to transfer all the research preserved by her Vesani ancestors into a sunstone and finally achieve the answers she had been looking for. However, she is eventually forced to make a decision; should she use the sunstone as a vessel to hold the memories of her people or to house Viego's discarded memories as a means to weaken him? Ahri, knowing what's at stake for the world, chose to store Viego's memories, causing the memories of her ancestors to fade away. Despairing over the loss, Ahri was suddenly faced with a memory of her dead lover, who forgave her for what she did. He explained that her memories will always be with her, but that it's more important to allow yourself to create new memories rather than dwell on old ones. He urges Ahri to keep fighting and to help save the world before finally fading away as Ahri thanks him for the closure.
As the crew managed to find the Buhru forge underneath the vault, Ahri joined the rest of the group as they bore their souls before Nagakabouros herself, battling the goddess's avatar and being found worthy of her help as the goddess cleanses the amulet.

Battle Against Viego
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Now back at Bilgewater, the crew finally battled the Ruined King while Ahri, wielding the sunstone containing his discarded memories, used her magic to weaken Viego, forcing him to remember the twisted parts of his love for Isolde. Once beaten, Ahri hit him with more of his memories, forcing him to relive his death when an angered wraith of Isolde killed him at the Blessed Isles. While distracted, Sarah Fortune used the opportunity to imprison Viego within the amulet. Though he nearly corrupted her soul and tempted her to follow him in the process, she was ultimately successful as the Ruined King was finally banished.
With the battle over, Ahri celebrated with her new friends at the Baron's Rest tavern, where each member of the group talked about their future plans now that Viego had been defeated. Ahri revealed that she plans on returning to the Shadow Isles, wishing to see what else she can learn from her ancestors and dedicating herself to living in their footsteps by bringing life and new memories to the world.

Ahri is an attractive female
Vesani
of medium stature with pale skin and long black hair down to her back tied in a braid with two long strands sticking out on the sides in her face. Her eyes are golden yellow with slit-shaped pupils and her cheeks have red, whisker-like marks on them. Due to her vastayan nature, she has black fox ears atop her head, long claws for nails and nine white fox tails. She usually wears a white dress with red and gold details as well as trinkets such as three purple tassels.
At times, usually when hiding her vastayan nature among society to stop from unwanted attention, Ahri wears a giant white hooded cloak to shield not only her face but also her nine white tails.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ahri started out as very savage and impulsive, growing up in the wilds away from civilization and becoming obsessed with consuming the spiritual essence of mortals. As she devoured more souls, she began to feel the emotions of her victims and became more empathetic and reluctant to continue her hunts. After the death of her lover, Ahri became consumed with regret and guilt, completely ashamed of her
Vesani
nature and distancing herself completely from society, only ever interacting with people to feast on their essence and sate her hunger. Ahri's pain grew so large that she simply wanted to forget all the painful memories, but ultimately decided that these memories were too valuable to let go of learned to carry her memories with her, no matter how painful they are.
Though deceivingly old and wise with the knowledge of the many memories she had consumed over the years, Ahri carries a youthful demeanor with a witty, mischievous and even flirty attitude. Although she remains somewhat moody and impulsive, sometimes losing control of her ravenous hunger, she has become incredibly empathetic with her abilities to consume emotions, even empathizing with those that would wish her harm. After choosing to cleanse the memories of her ancestors from her sunstones, Ahri found closure with her past and now lives to uphold the wisdoms of the Vesani by looking towards the future and allowing herself to make new memories instead of dwelling on her old ones.

Since childhood, Ahri has observed human civilization from afar until she encountered a hunter dying from a stray arrow. Curiously sensing his fading life force, Ahri got her first taste of spiritual essence and absorbed the man's memories, gaining all his knowledge and experiences. Since then, Ahri hunted down human prey for years, drunkenly drinking their essence and learning to manipulate them with her charms.
She slowly felt a sense of regret as she grew empathetic from absorbing human emotions, eventually seeing how they perceived her as a monstrous fox demon. Despite this, Ahri accepted her monstrous nature and continued to feast on human essence. It wasn't until she met her first and only love, a human artist, that she began to feel true sympathy for humans and decided to completely Now, after befriending
Yasuo
and the rest of
Sarah Fortune's
crew, she feels a deep sense of empathy and sympathy or her prey, sparing them from her hunger by learning to control it.

Dead Lover
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Years ago, Ahri fell in love with a human artist who remains as her first and only true love. Unlike the rest of Ahri's prey, the artist was the first person to willingly offer his essence to Ahri in exchange for her love, to which she agreed. From there, she felt true happiness for the first time as the two would often lay in a lake at the edge of Ionia. Unfortunately, Ahri lost control of her hunger one day and accidentally drained her lover completely, thoroughly killing him.
For years Ahri lived in constant regret over the death of her lover and attempted to remove the memories of him entirely at the
Garden of Forgetting
. In the process though, Ahri realized that her memories of her lover were too valuable to simply let go of and decided to live with them, no matter how painful it is to remember.
Ahri finally found closure with the death of her lover when she cleansed the memories of her ancestors from the sunstones at the
Buhru
forge. In the process of this, Ahri sorrowed over the loss of the memories of her ancestors but was confronted with a memory of her lover, who urged Ahri to fight for the future and told her to live life to create new memories instead of dwelling on her old ones. This interaction defined Ahri, allowing her to live as she does now, as a protector of life in the same vein as her Vesani ancestors.

Hirin
[

]

Hirin was a fortune teller that Ahri encountered in an
Ionian
market during her search for clues about her long-lost vastayan tribe. The fortune teller recognized Ahri's mysterious set of twin sunstones as the work of Ymelo, which intrigued Ahri as she agreed to enter her caravan for tea and to discuss more about her stones. Hirin revealed everything she knew about Ymelo to Ahri, before pulling out a hunting knife and revealing that she had put a paralysis potion in Ahri's cup of tea. Wishing to cut off one of her tails as an ingredient for her potions, Ahri managed to absorb enough of Hirin's essence to regain her strength and defend herself. Though she was furious at the betrayal, she looked into Hirin's memories and hardships in life, deciding to spare her life and leaving her without any memory of their encounter, essentially making her forget Ahri completely.

The Gardener
[

edit source
]

The Gardener is the mysterious caretaker of the
Garden of Forgetting
, also known as
Ighilya
by Ahri. The Gardener seems to be a person with some magical affinity rumored to be a witch of some sorts and offered Ahri guidance when she arrived to the garden with regret and sorrows over her dead lover. Though Ahri desperately begged the Gardener to help her forget these painful memories, she was reluctant to help her and urged her to live life with the pain and attempting to convince her that forgetting is much worse than living with the pain. As Ahri was in the process of feeding her memories to a snow lily given to her by the Gardener, she finally took her advice and refused to forget, believing that her memories of her lover were too valuable to forget. When the garden attempted to trap Ahri for interrupting the process, the Gardener quietly warned Ahri to leave before it was too late, allowing her to escape.

Ymelo
[

Ymelo is the famed sculptor said to have created Ahri's twin sunstones as well as many others. Though who his true origins are unknown, he's famed across the world for his ability to carve ancient fossilized eggs into intricate shapes and often creates small artifacts as pieces of larger sculptors. After learning of Ymelo, Ahri found clues leading her to Bilgewater, where she confronted a vendor at a black market and tried finding another of his sculptors, which the vendor sold to Malik of the
Jagged Hooks
.

Vesani
[
edit
|
edit source
]

The Vesani are Ahri's long-lost vastayan tribe. Since her childhood, Ahri was completely unaware of their existence and lived lost and questioning her origins. After embracing her nature as a vastaya, Ahri dedicated herself in finding clues about her Vesani ancestors, hoping that she could learn how to control her insatiable hunger for spiritual essence.
Her quest eventually lead her to the
Shadow Isles
, where she discovered the deep history the Vesani have with the now cursed Blessed Isles. By delving into their many vaults across the isles, studying their artifacts and sensing the memories left over by her people, Ahri learned that the Vesani were a nomadic tribe that traveled to the Blessed Isles and allied themselves with the
Helians
, becoming experts on magic related to memories.
When Ahri was forced to decide between containing the collected knowledge of her ancestors or the discarded memories of the
Ruined King
, she decided the latter and saw the memories of her people fade away. Mourning this, she was confronted by a memory of her long dead lover, who urged Ahri to fight for the future instead of dwelling on the past. With this, Ahri dedicates herself to upholding the teachings of the Vesani, becoming a protector of life and memories, looking to the future and creating new memories to honor her ancestors.

Crew of the Charming Lady
[

]

The crew of the Charming Lady is a group that come together in order to stop Viego and confront the Black Mist. Throughout their journey, Ahri forms a bond based on their shared experiences. This crew consisted of
Braum
,
Illaoi
,
Pyke
,
Yasuo
,
Ahri
and was led by
Sarah Fortune

Sarah Fortune
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Sarah Fortune is the captain of the Charming Lady and acts as the leader of the crew. Though she was initially distrustful of Ahri due to the fact that she fed on some of her crewmates' essences, she learned to trust and respect Ahri's powers after the crew found her in the
Shadow Isles
. Sarah is somewhat intimidated by Ahri's abilities, most notably her ability to absorb life essence and manipulate peoples' emotions, but she also respects them, often stating how she's jealous of Ahri's abilities to read people so easily and that she considers herself lucky to have Ahri on their side. The two eventually share even more respect for one another, as Ahri realizes the struggle Sarah faces when trying to maintain control of
Bilgewater
and Sarah respects Ahri's capability of restraining her hunger for spiritual essence.
The two were instrumental in defeating
Viego
together, as Ahri used the memories contained within her sunstone while Sarah proceeded to use the Buhru amulet on the weakened Ruined King.

Braum
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Braum was a member of the crew of the Charming Lady, having been the one who named the vessel in the first place. When the two first meet, Ahri admits that she initially assumed Braum was a
troll
when they first met due to his massive stature, which makes Braum laugh. The two become quick friends, as Ahri is one of the few on the crew that finds his boundless optimism and 'spirited' nature entertaining. Braum eventually confides in Ahri about Yasuo's unwavering dedication to protect her, which flatters Ahri and kickstarts her rising relationship with Yasuo as well. The two curiously exchange information about each other's homelands, such as Braum explaining the
Iceborn
to Ahri and even going so far as to invite her personally to visit the
Freljord
one day.

Illaoi
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Illaoi was a member of the crew of the Charming Lady and a close ally of Sarah Fortune. When they first find Ahri at the Shadow Isles, Illaoi is the one who suggest they join Ahri on entering the Vesani vaults. Unlike others, Illaoi doesn't share a sense of distrust or even fears Ahri's hunger at all, instead being mostly intrigued of her ability to sense the spirits and memories of the Vesani. Illaoi states to Ahri that she has proven she is worthy of their trust and that is why she has no reason to fear her, which Ahri is both cautioned yet flattered by. As the two empathize on their quests to seek their own truths and places in the universe, Illaoi preaches that she believes that their fates are intertwined and that, as a member of the crew, Ahri can seek the answers she is looking for.

Pyke
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Pyke was a member of the crew of the Charming Lady and joined the rest of the crew on their mission to stop the Ruined King. When they met, Ahri instantly knew that Pyke wasn't entirely human as he bluntly explained his vengeful origins. The two share similarities of having murderous pasts, but Ahri painfully reflects on hers while Pyke simply accepts his nature as a murderer and states Ahri should do the same. The two are also the only seemingly immortal members of the Charming Lady crew, as Pyke tells Ahri that he doesn't care about the future and only wants to find the revenge he's been searching for. Ahri, using her abilities, sees more on Pyke's mind beyond his desire to kill.

Yasuo
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ahri met Yasuo during a Spirit Blossom festival, hiring him to be her bodyguard on her way to
Bilgewater
. Though she initially kept her distance from him, not even revealing her name let alone her nature as a vastaya, he managed to find out the truth and, though Ahri was reluctant to keep him around, Yasuo still promised to stay by her side and disregarded Ahri's warnings of her ravenous nature. After of her dead lover, Ahri realized that bringing Yasuo was a mistake and instead ran away to continue her quest without him, seeing it as a mercy and a way of keeping Yasuo safe from herself. Despite this, Yasuo refused to fail as a body guard a second time and dedicated himself to finding Ahri, going as far as to join the crew of the Charming Lady on their way to the

Overtime, the two bond over their shared Ionian heritage and their renewed sense of purpose by travelling outside of their shared homeland. After being shipwrecked on a mysterious island with mystical winds, Ahri witnesses Yasuo confront the shadows of his past and empathies with his trauma, having a similar tragedy happen to her as well. Together, they vow to move past their own grief in favor of a better future.

In the final battle, Ahri was instrumental in Viego's defeat, clouding his mind with the discarded memories and forcing him to relive them. This weakened him enough to allow the rest of the crew to defeat him as Sarah Fortune imprisoned him within an amulet.
