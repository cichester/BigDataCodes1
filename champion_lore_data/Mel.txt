Early Life
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Mel was born in
Rokrund
to the
Medarda
family, one of the
Great Houses
of
Noxus
, with the true nature of her birth remaining shrouded by deception and secrecy. Her mother,
Ambessa Medarda
, was a respected general and military veteran in their clan, and while Ambessa was off fighting the empire's wars, Mel was raised by her father
Azizi
, a brilliant merchant who doted on and cared for her. When Mel's mother was home or taking her on campaigns, Ambessa taught her to live by the Medarda family code, and to embody the virtues of both the desert fox and the fearsome wolf of legend. Mel was always adept at embodying the Fox, as she held an uncanny gift for knowing the emotions of others—how they could be manipulated, won over, or molded to her benefit. However, this same empathy prevented her from embodying the Wolf, as compassion had no place on the battlefield.
When Mel's older brother
Kino
was dismissed as a possible heir to the family, Ambessa began preparing Mel for this role instead. Mel's political acumen was promising for her age, so Ambessa brought her on a tour to meet the leaders of the great Noxian cities, including the
Immortal Bastion
, where they got to see Grand General
Boram Darkwill
from a distance.
[

Ambessa also introduced Mel to the
Reckoner
arenas to learn the virtues of sacrifice, as they watched the mighty
Alistar
crush each of his opponents in the Noxidi Arena.
[
5
]
Mel was not receptive to Ambessa's teachings in the arena, nor did she enjoy watching what she considered a "blood sport." She felt disturbed by the level of violence that Noxians seemed to worship, when all she could see was a waste of life.
[

]
When Mel was fifteen, Ambessa took her on a campaign in the jungles near
Kumangra
for the conquest of an estate owned by the
Ionian
Binan family. When the battle had ended, Mel was summoned to the palace's throne room and given a test by her mother:
She
would have the choice to decide what should be done with the Binan leader,
Lady Mion
. Mel believed it would be wise to spare the prisoner's life and exile her to the far colonies, believing she would cause little trouble for them and that it would convince the local population that they were merciful. Ambessa, however, argued that showing mercy would be a sign of weakness, and she beheaded Mion with her katar. The image of Mion's head and broken necklace covered in blood haunted Mel for over a decade, and thoroughly traumatized, she and her mother returned to meet with their family in
Bel'zhun
.

Ambessa: Chosen of the Wolf

The Rakkor Painter
[

edit source
]

The situation in
Bel'zhun
was grave when Mel and
Ambessa
returned. Mel's great-grandfather, Hostlord Menelik, had been critically-wounded during a campaign, and as he lay on his deathbed, factions became to form regarding who should be next to succeed him as leader of
House Medarda
. When Menelik died without naming an heir, Mel left her family's compound for the artists' district, where she met a
wanderer
from
Targon
. The man was a sun worshipper of the
Rakkor
and a painter, and after confiding in him about how she had disappointed her mother, the man offered any one piece of art from his collection for her to bring home with her. Mel chose the man's golden tattoos, and she later met him at the Golden Drake inn to receive a set of her own.

Life in Bel'zhun
[
edit
|
edit source
]

After Mel had returned home and washed up that night, her mother summoned their family with urgent news: Ambessa and her cousin Ta'Fik had both made claims to succeed Menelik, and she had just earlier escaped an assassination attempt by one of Ta'Fik's supporters. Ambessa assigned
Azizi
and
Kino
tasks to help sabotage Ta'Fik's operations in Bel'zhun during her absence. She assigned Mel no task, instead ordering her to return home to
Rokrund Citadel
, where Mel would be kept safe under the guard of her uncle, Steward Katye. After Ambessa fled the city on her warships, Kino attempted to obey his mother's order to send Mel on a ship with Katye. Mel refused to go, and when Azizi intervened on her behalf, she was allowed to remain in Bel'zhun under the protection of the Wolf's Reapers.
Having foiled her mother's plan to send her home, Mel was now determined to prove that she could help their family in her own way. She began by taking Kino to watch the
Reckoners
match of their cousin Tivadar—Ta'Fik's youngest daughter, who had also been left behind as just as they were. Though Kino was skeptical of Mel's plan, Mel convinced him to get them a conversation alone together, which he accomplished by inviting Tivadar to his favorite noodle bar to celebrate her victory. After he left, Mel and Tivadar had a short but tense conversation in which Tivadar condemned Ambessa and Menelik for corrupting the Medarda family code so that it would cull the weakest family members. Mel sympathized with Tivadar, and after she had stormed out from their conversation, Mel spent a few more weeks trying to meet with her and eventually succeeded by relating to her feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. For the next few months, the two of them enjoyed a tentative friendship, where they would both spy on one another over tea, lunch, and
tellstones
.

Death of Azizi
[
edit
|
edit source
]

It was several months until Mel, Kino, and their father received their first letter from Ambessa, who informed them of her new alliance with
Vindor
and her plans to seek the aid of
Boram Darkwill
. Azizi and Kino both received tasks from Ambessa, but despite having learned that Mel was still in the city with them, Ambessa again did not assign any task for Mel. Upset by this, Mel was comforted by her father as they took a carriage into town, who informed Mel that she was wise and compassionate, and that her mother loved her more than she realized. Just as she was beginning to cheer up, their carriage was suddenly toppled over in an accident. Azizi was killed in the crash, and Mel suffered a broken arm and was rescued by several onlookers. One of the responders was a girl named
Elora
, whom Mel recognized as one of the Golden Drake inn's staff from when she was receiving her tattoos.
When Mel later woke up, Kino was watching over her bedside, and they began to suspect foul play in the crash. In their grief, Mel became suspicious of everyone—including Tivadar and the
Shuriman
rebels Ambessa had allied with. However, just one argument with Tivadar convinced Mel that accusing everyone would be unproductive, as a lack of trust would only serve to push her own allies away. As Kino left to begin his investigation alongside the Suns of Bel'zhun rebel group, Mel decided to ally with Elora, who had offered to help Mel write a letter to Ambessa informing her of the incident. She also apologized to Tivadar, and the three of them grew close as they began the hunt for Azizi's murderer.

Banishment
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Ambessa returned to Bel'zhun many months after she had originally left, and after a tearful reunion, Mel and Kino began to fill her in what they had been doing since Azizi's death. When Mel mentioned Tivadar, Ambessa became angry, claiming that Ta'Fik's daughter was not to be trusted, and that she had already faced Tivadar's sister Gintara in Rokrund, who had been killed during the conflict. To prepare for her confrontation with Ta'Fik, Ambessa intended to hold Tivadar for ransom. However, Mel considered Tivadar a close friend by this point, so she begged Ambessa to give her a chance to properly ally with them instead. Ambessa gave Mel one chance, declaring that
if
Tivadar helped them, then she would be allowed to take her father's place as the next steward of
Tereshni
. Mel relayed this deal to Tivadar, as well as the news of her sister's death. Tivadar was reluctant to help her sister's killer, but Mel convinced her that the war needed to end, and that if she didn't talk her father down from the invasion, then the two of them might very well be next. The next morning, Mel and her mother found Tivadar's room empty, as she had already left for Tereshni. Ambessa was furious with Mel for letting her get away.
Ambessa returned from Tereshni wounded and without Tivadar, and she informed them of Ta'Fik's death, which made her head of House Medarda. Her lack of any comment on Tivadar confirmed Mel's fears: Tivadar was dead. Worse than that, Tivadar had helped Ambessa defeat Ta'Fik, and yet Ambessa had killed her anyway. When Mel confronted her mother about this, Ambessa argued Tivadar's death was a necessary loss, and that Mel's weakness with regards to her had put their entire mission at risk. For that, she was being sent on a ship to the distant city of
Piltover
, where she would meet with instructors and defend their family's interests in the region until further notice. Heartbroken, Mel was allowed to say goodbye to Kino and bring one person to accompany her on the journey before setting sail.

Arcane

Early Adulthood
[
edit
|
edit source
]

At the docks of
Piltover
, Mel was greeted by
Jago Medarda
,
[
6
]
a member of their house responsible for overseeing the operations of the Sun Gates.
[
4
]
Mel brought
Elora
with her from
Bel'zhun
, who left her job at the Golden Drake inn to become her assistant. As her mother had predicted, Mel's political acumen made her more than adept at managing the
Medarda
family's business interests in the region, and after securing a deal with
House Ferros
, she became the richest person in all of Piltover.
[
7
]
Mel also rose to a seat on the Piltover Council, in large part due to the Medardas' influence in the city.
[
8
]
Still, Ambessa's words haunted Mel, and she always felt her personal wealth paled in comparison to that of the rest of her family. She began looking for an enterprise that could revolutionize Piltover so that she might restore her honor as a
Noxian
, and to convince her family that she was in fact worthy of the Medarda name.

Discovery of Hextech
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Mel first learned about
hextech
during the trial of
Jayce Talis
, a rogue Academy student and aspiring inventor who sought to create magic through science. Jayce's ambitious drive towards innovation intrigued Mel, and though the ethos demanded he be banished from Piltover, Mel instead supported a lighter sentence that resulted in Jayce's expulsion from the Academy, convincing
Councilor Hoskel
to support the motion as well.
[
7
]
To make the most of this investment, Mel later helped Jayce and
Viktor
sneak into
Heimerdinger's
lab, then concealed their activities by distracting the Academy guards.
[
9
]
Heimerdinger arrived too late to thwart the experiment, and with Mel's assistance, the inventors managed to convince the Council to support their enterprise. This decision would lead to the widespread implementation of hextech across the City of Progress, including the construction of the Hexgate, which transformed Piltover into a global shipping lane at the Council's request.
[
10
]

Piltovan Bicentennial
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Years after the invention of hextech had catapulted Jayce to stardom across Piltover, Mel was scheduled to be present for his bicentennial Progress Day speech, and she eagerly awaited his next invention. Before the speech, Jayce confided in Mel that Heimerdinger advised him to delay his showcase so they could work out all the necessary safety measures, and although Mel advised Jayce to simply ignore Heimerdinger, he decided at the last moment to keep his inventions secret from the public. Mel and Elora left the celebration early, irritated that they had nothing to show for the investors.
Later that night, a
terrorist
from the undercity bombed the Academy Square and stole a hextech gemstone and several notes from Jayce's laboratory, and fearing the thief might weaponize it, Jayce suggested that the Council shut down all hextech operations. The other councilors refused, as their profits directly depended on the Hexgate. Instead, Mel recommended that Jayce be instated as a Council member so he could safeguard Hexgate directly—a radical suggestion since the Council had, up until that point, only ever held seven seats. Heimerdinger agreed with Mel's proposal, and after putting the matter to a vote, House Talis was elevated to their august body.
[
10
]
Having increased Jayce's authority, Mel was determined to mold him into a leader who could revolutionize Piltover, without Heimerdinger's interference. Though Jayce was reluctant to get involved in politics, Mel guided Jayce to win the political and financial support of prominent figures like
Amara
, which he accomplished by offering exclusive, firsthand access to his future inventions. Mel was impressed by how quickly Jayce had adapted, and after expanding their influence, they both bonded on how they would use it to promote good. At night on the balcony, Mel expressed her romantic feelings for Jayce. He reciprocated, and after a night of passion together, Mel woke up to find Jayce had left without so much as a goodbye.
[
11
]
The next morning, Mel was working on her painting of the
Immortal Bastion
when Jayce returned to apologize for his sudden disappearance. While initially receiving Jayce coldly, Mel softened after Jayce explained that Viktor was terminally ill, and she moved to comfort him. Jayce confided in Mel about his frustrations; that he had been too distracted with politics to accomplish any of the good he sought out to do with hextech, and that he felt helpless to save his best friend. Mel disclosed that she had been exiled from her family because they thought she was unworthy; a belief which Jayce strongly disagreed with. Mel then reassured Jayce that although he may not be able to save Viktor, he should spend his remaining time with him so he wouldn't feel alone in his final moments.
In the following days, Mel supported Jayce in some of his hardest decisions. When Heimerdinger threatened to obstruct Viktor's hexcore research, Mel was the first to back Jayce's motion to have him removed from the Council, and they voted him out for his failure to prevent the ongoing crisis with the undercity.
[
12
]
Jayce felt guilty about betraying his mentor, but Mel justified his actions by stating Heimerdinger's removal was necessary, and as the Council's new de facto leader, Jayce could finally bring hextech to the masses like he had always dreamed. Mel later received word that her mother would be arriving from
Noxus
, and she worried that Jayce was not ready for this kind of attention from overseas. She approached Jayce and Viktor and suggested they start developing hextech weapons for Piltover's defense, having deduced that it was a program Jayce was already considering. Viktor was vehemently against Mel's proposal, but Jayce appeared more conflicted, leading to an argument between the two inventors. Mel left the decision to them before leaving the laboratory.
[

Arrival of General Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]


As the reunion with her mother neared, Mel was woken up by nightmares from her childhood, and later visited the aftermath of another bombing on the Bridge of Progress. When Ambessa arrived on her warship, she was critical of Mel, claiming that
Kino
had been killed after crossing the "wrong man", and that she had come to give her proper guidance. Ambessa said that Mel's reluctance to quash the undercity's threat had let the situation spiral out of control, and that the solution to this problem was hextech weaponry. This confirmed Mel's fears, and she rejected her mother's advice, as it would necessitate a brutal war that would destroy everything she had built.
At the next Council meeting,
Caitlyn Kiramman
and
Vi
revealed to the Council that a criminal kingpin named
Silco
was the mastermind behind the ongoing crisis, and that his ultimate goal was establish an independent "Nation of
Zaun
" which would encompass the entire undercity. Mel advocated diplomacy with Silco, and was shocked to hear Jayce was in support of a full-scale retaliation to bring him down by force.
[
14
]
Mel quickly discovered that her mother had met with Jayce to manipulate him onto the path of war, and she went to confront Ambessa, who dismissed her daughter's anger and revealed the truth of her visit: Kino's killer was a powerful threat to the Medardas, and she needed hextech weapons to be developed to use against them. Ambessa declared that if Mel helped to start a war, she would be allowed to return to Noxus and rule the Medardas by her side. Mel was disgusted that Ambessa would let innocents suffer just to save herself, and she severed ideological ties to their house, defacing her painting of the Immortal Bastion.
After an unsanctioned raid on Silco's
shimmer
factory, Jayce managed to broker a peace with the crime lord in exchange for Zaun's independence. Mel was the first councilor to agree to Jayce's proposal, persuading the rest to follow suit. However, when the meeting was almost done and the crisis nearly resolved, the Council was suddenly caught in a
terrorist attack
,
[
15
]
which left most of its members dead or injured. Though Mel and Jayce had been closest to where the rocket had hit, the area they were standing was the least damaged in the entire room. The situation bewildered them both, but they had no time to question the matter in the face of the gruesome tragedy that lay before them. In the aftermath, Jayce abandoned his spot on the Council to remain in his laboratory with a comatose Viktor, leaving Mel,
Salo
, and
Shoola
as the only remaining councilors. Mel then learned the details of the attack from Caitlyn, who informed her that
Jinx
was the one responsible, and that Silco was dead.
The remaining Council met to discuss their options for a response to Jinx's attack. Although Mel was reluctant to use force against Zaun, she was overruled by the other two, who demanded an invasion led by the
Piltover Enforcers
. Realizing her mother was now manipulating Salo, Mel agreed to endorse the invasion in order to present a united front, on the condition that hextech weapons would not be used. Mel's proposal won over Shoola, and they outvoted Salo. At the memorial service for the councilors who had died, Mel was again attacked by one of
Renni's
henchmen, who had arrived to avenge her son who had been killed during Jayce's raid. The
chembaron
was killed by Ambessa, who began to take a more active role in managing Piltovan affairs.
[
16
]
Worried by her mother's growing influence, Mel sent an informant,
Lest
, to spy on her, and she learned that Ambessa and Salo were planning a gathering of all the mercantile clans to enact martial law. Before Mel could do anything to stop her mother's plans, she was suddenly kidnapped by the
Black Rose
, who killed Elora and left no witnesses to Mel's disappearance.

Awakening as a Mage
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Mel awoke in an Oculorum, a special chamber that was designed with a test for imprisonment, as well as a deadly punishment for failure. Here, she was surprised and relieved to learn that Kino was alive and was being held in the same prison as she was. After a happy reunion, the siblings reconnected as Mel worked her way around the chamber, and Kino explained an important discovery he'd made in
Basilich
: Ambessa had an affair with a powerful mage, and her child had inherited abilities that were of special interest to their captors. Mel, disturbed by Kino's story, realized he wasn't acting like himself and realized he was actually an illusion conjured up by her jailer. The Oculorum dissolved around them, and the shapeshifter attacked her with magical thorns, which she instinctively destroyed by shielding herself in rays of magical light, awakening her latent powers as a
mage
.
[
2
]
With the test completed, Mel was greeted by a
mysterious sorceress
, who concealed her true face by taking the form of
Lady Mion
in the Binan throne room. The sorceress congratulated Mel on unlocking her powers, but Mel was still in shock, and demanded to know where her brother was. The sorceress revealed the Kino was in fact dead, but blamed Ambessa's pride for getting him killed. She explained that Ambessa's "thirst for legacy" had blinded her to an extent that her actions were about to unleash a cataclysmic threat, comparable to the ancient
Rune Wars
in its devastation, and as a result she had to be stopped at all costs. While Mel was reluctant to kill her mother, the sorceress stated that Mel did not have a choice regarding her "new family", and she gave Mel a special amulet to call upon her assistance when the moment was right. After being initiated into the Black Rose, Mel left the fortress and returned to Piltover.
Mel found Jayce in the rebuilt Council chamber, where he reacted aggressively towards her, as he figured out she was a mage and her powers had been used to save him and not the others. Mel pleaded that the original use of her powers was sheer instinct. Jayce also accused her of using him and Viktor for hextech, and Mel defended her sponsorship of the enterprise, listing the positive qualities she saw in Jayce and Viktor that led her to invest in them. While Mel was speaking, Jayce was suddenly plagued by visions, and the two of them were interrupted by a faceless metal humanoid that spoke in Viktor's voice. Viktor informed them that Ambessa was planning an invasion of the city and that he was going to help her if Jayce did not join him in enacting his "
Glorious Evolution
" at the Hexgate. Viktor attacked them when Jayce refused his offer, and although Mel used her powers to help destroy the puppet, Jayce and Mel were both shaken, as they had just barely survived.

Battle at the Hexgate
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Having learned her mother's intentions, Mel left for Zaun to negotiate with Ambessa. Here, she pleaded that Piltover had nothing to do with Ambessa's feud, and she now had the power to avenge Kino if they both returned to Noxus together. However, Ambessa still did not believe Mel was capable of defeating the Black Rose and instead put her trust into Viktor, who had raised an entire army of metal puppets that Ambessa claimed had no fear of death.
[
17
]
Having failed to convince her mother from her warpath, Mel returned to Piltover to plan the city's defense.
On the battlefield, Mel defended
Caitlyn
from being executed, after which Mel continued to try and convince her mother to recognize everything she had sacrificed, including the lives of Kino,
Rictus
, and the entire city Mel had spent years building for them. Mel's pleas failed to sway her mother, and she and Caitlyn dueled Ambessa as Viktor's puppets swarmed their surroundings. Ambessa outmatched them both and managed to cut out one of Caitlyn's eyes, but Caitlyn had in turn stolen Ambessa's
kaenic rookern
, allowing Mel to use the amulet to summon the Black Rose sorceress, who mortally wounded Ambessa with her magic. Mel, however, had no intention of being the Black Rose's puppet and glimpsed the
LeBlanc's
face before destroying the shadow in a radiant burst of light. As Ambessa lay dying in her daughter's arms, she looked at her with pride before declaring "You are the Wolf."

Return to Noxus

Main article:
Welcome to Noxus

After the death of her mother, Mel left
Piltover
and the Council and took her mother's battle mask, as well as command of her warband. She returned to Noxus on her mother's warship in search of answers. At the shores of
Rokrund
, Mel went to the Noxtoraa and saw a vision of the
Immortal Bastion
, where she was fighting a pair of Black Rose
hemomancers
at the gates and was nearly crushed by falling rubble. After receiving the vision, Mel and her soldiers set off for the Noxian capital.
[
19
]
Mel attended a
Reckoners
match in the Noxidi Arena, located in the Immortal Bastion's
Shuriman
quarter, where she reminisced on a time her mother had attempted to teach her about "sacrifice" as the fourth principle of Noxus, where the mark of a true warrior was a person's willingness to give up anything—even their own allies—to achieve victory. Mel rejected her mother's lesson, standing firm that mercy and compassion were not the weaknesses Ambessa thought them to be.

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Mel is an attractive, slender, brown-skinned woman with hazel eyes, which match those of her biological father,
Rudo
. She has dark, curly hair with jeweled twists at her hairline. Mel's tattoos, which were painted in golden ink, are made to resemble golden armor and pauldrons, and were deliberately made to match the markings of
Targonian
sun worshippers.
[
4
]
As a councilor, Mel wore elegant white clothing with golden sun imagery, which was made to reflect the
Medarda
family's roots as traders off the coast of
Shurima
, which is also mixed with common
Piltovan
patterns. After learning she was a mage, Mel began wearing a white hooded robe over a black garment with similar golden accents. Upon returning to
Noxus
on her mother's warship, Mel replaced the white robe with an expensive, long flowing red cape and skirt accented with black and intricate gold patterns, as well as silver armor pieces.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Mel had a clever and analytical personality, with an ambition born from feelings of inferiority within the powerful and wealthy
Medarda
family. Mel's heightened sense of empathy granted her a keen understanding of the people around her, and though she would be compelled towards compassion, her banishment to
Piltover
convinced her to bury these feelings, as she felt that her "weakness" had led her to fall short of Medarda standards. As a politician, Mel became manipulative of the Piltovan upper classes, and she became bored by their lack of new ideas. She also grew somewhat callous towards the suffering of the lower classes, allowing the other councilors to turn the
undercity
upside down without vetoing the motion, and saw little issue with corruption, viewing it as a reality of politics that could be leveraged to expand one's influence. In her efforts to prove herself, Mel sought to avoid Piltover's stagnation at all costs, and she invested heavily in enterprises which would help improve the city's global standing and prosperity.
Mel's relationship with
Jayce
, as well as the arrival of her
mother
, shook Mel's outlook on the Medarda name, as she saw just how much Ambessa's manipulations had damaged Jayce's idealism and brought the city on the brink of all-out war. She grew defiant as she had been in her youth and reaffirmed her commitment to peace with Zaun, and continued to clash with her mother's aggression for the city she built for their family. After Mel had finally defeated Ambessa, she returned to
Noxus
with a renewed sense of purpose, viewing compassion and mercy as a source of her strength.

Abilities
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Mage
:
Mel was born with natural magical abilities from her biological father
Rudo
, who was a celestial mage of the
Black Rose
.
[
4
]
She was able to perceive the puzzle patterns of her prison and believed she could unravel them, and was able to repel the magic of even
LeBlanc
, a powerful and ancient sorceress.
Empath
: Mel possesses a rare and powerful form of magic. As an empath, Mel is attuned to the arcane, with her abilities she is able to sense the inner selves of others and bend their magic as both a "conduit" and a "mirror," which allows her to reflect the magic of others against them.
[
17
]
Celestial Light Magic
: Mel can manipulate light as a conduit for her magical powers, she is able to generate intense rays of light from her body, which can be used to create
barriers
,
luminous bolts
that can explode and be shaped into whips, and
orbs
that radiate solar energy. Mel can also envelop herself in this energy to create a
radiant destructive supernova
.
Golden Tattoos:
Mel's tattoos, which were painted in ink to resemble golden armor and pauldrons, were given to her by Rudo in
Bel'zhun
. They were made in the style of the
Rakkor
, and were secretly imbued with
rune magic
designed to inhibit her magical abilities, which prevented the
Black Rose
from detecting her for over a decade.
[
4
]
Diplomacy:
From an early age, Mel can be seen to have a knack at politics. Mel is a consummate political strategist, and she has been able to sway politicians and influential people to conform to her agenda. During her time living in Piltover, she rose to the power of a councilor, despite her position within her own family, and even became the richest person in the entire city.
[
7
]
Painter:
Mel is a talented painter, specifically with egg tempera paintings, having been inspired to pursue this hobby after acquiring a painting from Rudo in the Shimmering Market.
[

]
Currently all the paintings in her home were done by her.

Relations
[
edit
|
edit source
]

House Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Mel was raised in one of the oldest and most powerful noble houses in all of
Noxus
. Unlike her mother, who saw the Medarda legacy as a source of her own glory and greatness, Mel felt inadequate in her house's shadow, even long before she was exiled to
Piltover
. To prove she was capable, Mel went through great lengths to end the Medarda civil war by joining forces with her cousin Tivadar, so that they could end the bloodshed that was bringing their house to ruin. Mel's plan failed as Ambessa did things her way, through a violent takeover of the clan, after which she exiled Mel for showing mercy on their enemies. In Piltover, Mel came to believe she had fallen short of Medarda standards and continued to try and prove herself by investing in
hextech
, which could transform Piltover into an influential and prosperous city worthy of her family name. Since she returned to Noxus, Mel now believes that she can rebuild the Medarda legacy with compassion instead of sacrifice; in stark contrast to her mother's teachings.

Ambessa Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]


A brutal Noxian warlord, Ambessa taught her daughter about the art of war from a very young age in hopes that she would one day succeed her as heir. However, while Ambessa approved of Mel's cunning and statecraft, Ambessa was disappointed by Mel's lack of cutthroat instincts. Mel, in turn, felt stifled by her mother, who was dismissive of her "soft-spined idealism" and refused to allow her to help in matters critical to the survival of their family. She believed that Ambessa's ruthless, violent mindset was a waste of human lives, as Ambessa's refusal to show mercy would deprive her of potential future allies. Ambessa would not tolerate Mel's different worldview, and for fear that Mel's "weakness" would prevent her from keeping their family safe, she finally banished her to
Piltover
.
Mel was shown to fear her mother while also resenting her for her past actions, leaving their relationship strained. She would eventually confront her about it, which would lead to Mel symbolically cutting ties with her Noxian roots. After learning the details about Ambessa's feud with the
Black Rose
, Mel attempted to convince her mother to join her so they could avenge Kino's death together. Ambessa would not relent, still believing Mel was a "fox" for trying to show mercy on Piltover, and therefore incapable of taking on an enemy like the Rose. After a more direct confrontation on the battlefield, Mel would eventually prove Ambessa wrong by besting both her and LeBlanc by pitting them against one another. Though this led to Ambessa's death, she looked at Mel with pride, declaring that she was "the Wolf". After the war in Piltover, Mel would take her mother's place as leader of the warband, seemingly uneasy with her new role and responsibilities.

Azizi Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]

As
Ambessa's
husband, the general would rely on Azizi to raise her children in her absence, and as a result, both Mel and
Kino
took after him more than they did her. As Mel's father, Azizi was patient and supportive, and Mel loved him a great deal for listening to her and giving her chances to prove herself when her mother would not. In their final conversation before his death, Azizi reassured Mel that he admired her determination, her wisdom, and her compassion, and he tried to mediate the emotional rift between her and Ambessa. Azizi's death left Mel so devastated that she lashed out at some of the people close to her for a short time, after which she came to terms with it and resolved to find the people responsible.

Kino Medarda
[

Kino Medarda was Mel's older brother, and they had a typical sibling relationship—bickering on occasion, but always ready to help and comfort one another when it was needed. Kino was said to be gifted with a silver tongue and also believed that he could talk his way out of anything. Kino used to tell Mel that war was "a failure of statecraft", and Mel agreed with this sentiment. Which indicates that Kino was one of the few members of his family for whom Mel had a lot of love and affection. Mel was visibly shocked when Ambessa delivered the news of her brother's death. After she was kidnapped by the
Black Rose
, Mel encountered a prisoner who bore Kino's appearance and was overjoyed and relieved to learn that her brother was alive. However, Mel was able to recognize her brother's odd behavior during their conversation and deduced that he was merely an illusion summoned by her jailer, a
shapeshifting sorceress
, meant to deceive her. Having learned the truth, Mel accepted her brother's death and moved to avenge him by betraying the Rose later on.

Tivadar Medarda
[

]

Tivadar was Mel's cousin and the daughter of
Ambessa's
mortal enemy in the clan, Steward Ta'Fik of
Tereshni
. As their parents clashed during the
Medarda
civil war, Mel and Tivadar were both left behind in
Bel'zhun
and attempted to spy on each other for their parents' benefit. Tivadar was initially cold towards Mel, who at first attempted to form a connection by watching her matches in the
Reckoner Arena
, but Mel was able to get through to her by relating to her on a personal level, as they both felt their own parents regarded them as useless. Over time, Mel and Tivadar became close friends, playing
tellstones
and going for lunch together, and Tivadar even helped Mel to investigate the culprits behind her
Azizi's
death. After Ta'Fik invaded
Rokrund
, he ordered Tivadar to kill Mel, and Ambessa ordered Mel to help her take Tivadar hostage. They both refused and formed a separate plan to try and end the conflict peacefully. Ambessa's decision to kill Tivadar irreparably ruined their relationship, as Mel had considered her a true friend.

Rudo

Rudo was a
Targonian
agent of the
Black Rose
who, unbeknownst to Mel, was secretly her biological father. They met only once in the artists' district of
Bel'zhun
, where Rudo disguised himself as a simple shopkeeper so he would have the opportunity to speak with her and to see what kind of person she had grown up to be. Although she regarded him as a stranger, Mel felt a connection to the man and was inspired by his beautiful artwork, confiding in him about how she always struggled to live up to her
Ambessa's
expectations. Rudo offered her helpful advice, as well as one of his paintings to Mel. She chose a set of
Rakkor
tattoos to match his, which he imbued with powerful runes to keep the powers she had inherited from him hidden from the
pale woman
. Rudo also gave Mel one of his paintings anyway, which she kept on display in her room in Bel'zhun. His artwork marked the beginning of her interest in fine art, and Mel eventually took up painting as a hobby.

Elora

Elora was Mel's best friend and closest confidante. They first met as teenagers in
Bel'zhun
at the Golden Drake inn, where Elora was working on the staff and helped prepare Mel to receive her
Targonian
tattoos. Months later, Elora was among the civilians in the crowd who rescued Mel from the wreckage of her
Azizi's
carriage, and she later arrived to check on her. Mel's writing arm had been broken in the crash, so Elora offered to help her with the letter she was struggling to write.
Ambessa
had always taught Mel to be wary of who she trusted. Mel decided to break with this mindset, as she sensed that Elora was intelligent, observant, and a potential ally. Elora helped Mel investigate her father's death for the next few months, and they became close friends. After Mel was exiled to
Piltover
, she was allowed to choose one person from Bel'zhun to accompany her on the trip.

Elora finally left her job at the Golden Drake to become Mel's personal assistant in Piltover, and she remained in this position for the rest of her life.
As Mel's assistant, Elora handled many of lady's communications with her business and political associates, including those with
House Ferros
. Due to how closely they worked, Elora was aware of many of Mel's grander schemes, as well as her past and relationship with her mother. Elora was highly dedicated to both Mel's political ascent and her emotional well-being, expressing concern whenever something appeared to be troubling Mel and becoming apologetic whenever she felt she had failed her. Mel was later devastated when Elora was killed by the
Black Rose
.

Black Rose
[

edit source
]

The true nature of Mel's birth was kept a secret from both her and the Black Rose, as her father
Rudo
—one of their agents—knew that the cabal would claim ownership of Mel if they were to learn she was his.
[

]
The Black Rose did not learn Mel's secret until decades later, when Mel's brother
Kino
unearthed evidence of
Ambessa's
affair in
Basilich
, after which they had Kino kidnapped and murdered. The Black Rose also killed Mel's best friend,
Elora
, and drove Ambessa to madness in her quest for vengeance, before eventually capturing Mel herself and locking her in a chamber designed to test her magical abilities. As a result of their actions, Mel was not fond of the Black Rose and actively plotted against them as soon as they set her free. When they spoke after the test,
LeBlanc
referred to Mel as "sister" and manipulated her into joining their ranks, despite Mel's initial reluctance to kill her own mother. After learning the threat Ambessa posed to
Piltover
, Mel was able to defeat both her mother and LeBlanc by briefly siding with the Black Rose until her mother was defeated, then double-crossing them immediately afterward; a move that was both clever and merciless, which finally earned Mel her mother's approval.
As Mel's abilities as an empath are extremely rare, the Black Rose remains interested in her, with
Vladimir
continuing to refer to her as an "opportunity" even after she had already turned on them.

Cecil B. Heimerdinger
[

Mel respected Heimerdinger as the founder of Piltover. However, she saw his conservative and stifling ways to be a hindrance to her rise to power, and to the greater prosperity of Piltover as a whole. She would undermine his authority by aiding
Jayce
and
Viktor
to complete their experiment, then by legalizing the use of hextech in Piltover. When Heimerdinger convinced Jayce to postpone his gemstone presentation, Mel elevated Jayce to a Council seat, which allowed Jayce to circumvent Heimerdinger and later have him removed from the Council—a measure which Mel was the first to vote in favor of.

Jayce Talis
[

]

While initially using Jayce to gain more wealth and prestige, Mel would eventually have some deeper feelings towards the inventor—even defending him from the self-serving influence of her ambitious
mother
. She would be concerned over his issues and would give him sound advice, all while still putting her own goals into consideration. Over time, Mel became less reserved around Jayce and began sharing personal details about herself as well. While Mel's relationship with Jayce started out as a means to an end, it ultimately became sincere love for his ideals and optimism. Mel was crucial in Jayce's meteoric rise to fame: she even swayed the Council to elevate Jayce and grant him a seat on the Council. Jayce credited a large part of his success to Mel, as he felt that nothing was impossible as long as she was around. Mel, in turn, showed a great deal of concern for Jayce's wellbeing, and after he and
Viktor
made clear that developing weapons went against what they stood for, she opposed her mother's attempts to start a war that would force them into this position.
Jayce would eventually confront Mel about her earlier manipulations of him and Viktor, but they would remain on good terms following the argument, with Jayce even reassuring Mel that she would never be a "passenger" in her own life. The two of them were instrumental in the defense of Piltover. After Jayce and Viktor had sacrificed themselves to destroy the hexcore, Mel presumably mourned him before leaving Piltover.

Viktor
[

]

Mel and Viktor, while not close, maintained a working relationship for several years while he and
Jayce
were building
hextech
inventions at the Council's request. Viktor had always sought to use hextech to help the poor and suffering, but Mel prioritized elevating Piltover's global status, which she achieved by ordering the construction of the Hexgate. When Jayce approached Mel about Viktor's terminal illness, she expressed concern, as she hadn't realized how close the two of them were. Viktor was later outraged when Mel suggested developing hextech weapons, calling her "ridiculous" for floating the possibility. In the name of peace, Mel eventually chose to support Jayce and Viktor's motion for Zaun's independence, and the three of them briefly celebrated before they were caught in
Jinx's
terrorist attack. Mel and Jayce were spared from the blast, but Viktor was not.
After Viktor had become the Herald, he attacked Mel and Jayce and was seemingly intrigued by Mel's newfound connection to the arcane. Mel and Jayce were able to defeat the puppet with the help of her magical abilities, but when she went to negotiate with Ambessa, Mel was horrified to see that Viktor had raised an entire army of his evolved soldiers. Upon her return, she and the Piltovan defense made plans to kill Viktor and save the city.
