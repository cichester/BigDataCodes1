Early Existence
[

What would become Evelynn started as a primordial, shapeless, and barely sentient entity, barely a shadow. This entity was left this way for a long time, numb to everything and barely existing for centuries.

Awakening and Adaptation
[

When the
Rune Wars
happened, thousands of people suffered and died. This stimulated the entity, and it was affected by the manic vibrations of all the suffering of the people of
Runeterra
. This pleasured and nourished the entity, transforming it into a different creature, a demon that fed on the pain of others.
When the Rune wars ended, the creature was left hungry and desperate for the pleasure that others' suffering provided it. It subsequently decided that it would have to cause the pain that it needed itself.
To catch its prey, people, it would have to form itself into something tangible, but it  could never make a form that didn't scare its prey away. It decided to study humans and see what they liked. By watching from the shadows, the demon was able to craft itself a form that attracted prey and learned to talk in a way that was alluring to them. As it amassed victims, it got better and better at attracting prey, until a point where it could lure prey in with ease.
Despite killing dozens, the demon isn't able to completely satiate its hunger and can only hold itself over until its next meal. Because she has never felt a pleasure so great since the Rune Wars, Evelynn dreams of a day when she can plunge the world into anarchy and feel that ecstasy again.

Evelynn made a cult designed to attract worshipers who would do her bidding. While traveling through
Valoran
with her teacher Frey,
Vayne
heard of this and traveled to the meeting place of the cult. Despite being injured by a member of the cult and killing her own teacher on the way, Vayne continued her journey to the meeting place with the intent of finally killing Evelynn.

Appearance

While Evelynn can change her form at will, she often takes the form of a beautiful curvaceous human woman with pink hands and claws, two "lashers" resembling twin tails, light blue skin and pink and white hair. This form includes constantly shifting "clothes" that show off most of her body.
In her shadow form, Evelynn's body becomes pitch black, her lashers obtain magenta tips and she sprouts magenta horns.

Personality
[

Evelynn is a predatory demon who finds pleasure in other people's pain. She inflicts pain on others to satisfy her never-ending hunger and to experience pleasure. Although she lures her prey with promises of sexual pleasure, she does not actually engage in the creation of carnal pleasures, probably because she finds no entertainment in it of her own. To close this gap, Evelynn prefers to prey on happy people, because they are the only ones with something to lose. Behind her pretty exterior hides a very sadistic, sarcastic, and hilarious nature; after all, for her, killing seduced victims is exactly the same as a love game for people who really love each other.
Under this persona, Evelynn is charming and flirty towards her victims, manipulating others towards her doom. She prefers those that live happy lives, and then brings them to the peak of ecstasy so that their agony is more intense, relishing in her cruelty.

Like Tahm Kench, Evelynn is classified as a demon, and they seem to know each other. She considers him a rival, as they both prey on humans and do not consider sharing food.
