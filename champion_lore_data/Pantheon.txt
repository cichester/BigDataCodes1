Early life

Atreus
was born on the slopes of
Mount Targon
, belonging to the tribes of the Rakkor. From a young age, Atreus would train for battle, joining the military unit of the Rakkor, the Ra'Horak. Never particularly talented, nor possessing any innate strength, young Atreus would constantly fail every training regiment and bout he partook in. However, his impressive endurance and relentless fighting spirit always ensured that he would stand back up, in spite of how bloodied and bruised he would be after each encounter. This would earn him the respect of his much more skilled rival and eventual best friend, Pylas, whom Atreus would constantly challenge despite being outmatched in every fight. Through the bloodied and gruesome training circles, Pylas and Atreus would forge a strong bond of brotherhood, a bond that only grew stronger as the two battled proudly for their tribe.

The Aspect of War
[

Atreus and his Ra'Horak companions were ambushed by a barbarian incursion looking to make way into Rakkor territory. The battle would leave most of the patrol dead, save for Atreus and Pylas. The two would seek retribution for their fallen comrades from the Aspect of the Sun, but the Aspect refused to lend aid to fight off the trespassers making their way into their homes. Outraged, Atreus and Pylas vowed to end the fight themselves by making the climb to Targon's peak to acquire power.
Similar to the many people that previously attempted to make the climb, the two underestimated the intensity and difficulty of the task. It was a difficult trial, as the two would eventually make their way to the top, but with Pylas dying on the peak of the mountain in Atreus' arms. With Atreus the only one at the peak, the skies opened for the gods to choose their host. Atreus was taken by the Aspect of War, the Pantheon.
Pantheon deemed Atreus too unworthy to wield the power it possessed, but War needed a host body. It took over Atreus' body, stopping Atreus from having any control over the body that Pantheon now inhabited.
What Atreus endured while Pantheon took over his body were visions of Pantheon looking for the
Darkin
across
Runeterra
, the living weapons that remained after the
Darkin Wars
.
Eventually, Pantheon faced
Aatrox
. Aatrox sought to reach the peak of Targon, with Pantheon arriving to stop the Darkin's ascent. They battled, and it ended with Aatrox driving his blade into the aspect, killing it and erasing its constellation from the skies.
With Pantheon gone, Atreus reawoke, finding himself impaled with the Darkin's blade. Bleeding and on the verge of death, Atreus spit on Aatrox's face as an act of defiance. Aatrox was bemused by this and left Atreus to die.
Atreus stood back up, powered with nothing but bitter rage and regret at his own failings. He stumbled his way into Rakkor territory, until he reached the home of Iula, the widowed wife of Pylas. She nursed him back to health, and as Atreus recovered, he was reinvigorated to keep fighting, finding pride in being a mortal human being instead of a god.
While he recovered, he received news that a barbarian incursion was headed towards the territory that included Iula's farm. Atreus learned that it was led by Aatrox, who convinced the barbarians to invade Targonian settlements. Atreus picked up his weapons and headed to battle to confront Aatrox in an attempt to put an end to the madness.
When Atreus reached the site of battle, Aatrox saw the lack of power flowing through his spear and the scar which seared into both his shield and his body. Despite Aatrox's advantages, Atreus fought him, invigorated by the cries of the people around him. Just before he was about to be defeated, Atreus struck Aatrox's sword arm, detaching the Darkin from its host.
This act brought back Pantheon's constellation into the sky, and Atreus made a vow to be the shield, to protect all mortals against those that wanted to destroy them. Forsaking his name, he instead took the mantle of the Pantheon, the Aspect of War.

Resurrection of Pantheon
[

Atreus was present when
Viego
came to Targon to search for a fetter of queen Isolde's soul. He battled the Ruined King at the peak, but was overwhelmed by the time the Sentinels of Light arrived. Atreus' consciousness was subsumed, but Pantheon was resurrected by the king's magic and had taken control of his body. Pantheon attempted to bury the Sentinels with an avalanche, while Viego continued his search. When the Sentinels retaliated, Pantheon summoned an army of ghouls and leapt into battle. He was eventually defeated by
Diana
, but Viego had already secured the fetter. Pantheon went to the Shadow Isles and guarded the Sentinels as made their final stand against the Ruined King, where Viego would revive his queen. When Viego was defeated, Atreus was freed, and he reclaimed his body from Pantheon.

The Call

After the Aspect of War was defeated once again, Atreus visited Iula again. While there, he told her that he had finally given up. After the Aspect was defeated, Atreus lost his celestial powers and couldn't go on. He considered himself defeated after having experienced so much and didn't resist Iula when she pointed his own spear to his chest, even pulling it towards himself so that she could finish the job that the Aspect had started. Iula responded to this with anger. She told him that Pylas had died to make him the protector that he had become and the fact that he was throwing everything away was an insult to her and Pylas' memory. Pantheon left in shame, thinking of what Iula said.
Despite his despair, Atreus was reinvigorated by what Iula had said. With unclear motives, Atreus traveled into the territory of the Solari, to the location of a portal that they had constructed that went to the peak of Mount Targon. The Solari, along with
Leona
, fought him. Despite fighting valiantly, Pantheon was knocked off of the cliff that they were fighting on by a comet of unknown origin. At the bottom of the cliff, surrounded by the bodies and weapons of fallen soldiers, Atreus sat in quiet reflection. During this time, he found a reinvigorated passion. With this newfound passion, Atreus' celestial powers returned, and he flew into the night sky.

Appearance
[

edit source
]

Atreus is a physically imposing warrior, with a physique that is carved from a lifetime of training as a soldier. A deep scar runs across his chest, a scar which he received when he was impaled by Aatrox's Darkin blade. He sports the cape of Solstice, a blue ethereal cape with constellations of the sky gleaming from the very fabric. Within certain in-game depictions, when Pantheon has his helmet on, his visage darkens, tying into identity as a faceless soldier of war defending humanity. When his helmet is off, he has a mohawk and sports a thick beard, tied up to keep straight. His face, and much of his body, have golden Solari-based tattoos, which harken back to his Ra'Horak days.
When Pantheon was briefly resurrected after being Ruined by Viego, Pantheon's appearance changed drastically. Like most of the Ruined champions, Pantheon's chest had the dark and green downward facing triangle, signifying his Ruination. The shield he wielded bared a face with some similarity to Atreus. On top of a loincloth, Pantheon wears dark jeans and boots to match. The top of his helmet has a plume with long and thick white fur.

Personality
[

]

Stoic and unwavering, Atreus as Pantheon possesses a strong fighting spirit. As the stalwart defender of humanity, Pantheon often feels over-encumbered by his duties and his expectations as an Aspect. Despite his failings, he presses forward stubbornly, and he encourages all of his compatriots to do the same.
He is not very accepting of most god-like beings with immense powers, which include Aspects, Darkins, Ascendants, and demons alike. Given his own experience with War, Pantheon is hesitant in placing his trust with greater powers, preferring to rely on his own mortal will to fight his battles.

Abilities

The ascension into an Aspect has greatly increased Atreus strength, resistance and durability to superhuman levels, far above any mortal.
Celestial Magic:
Pantheon can call forth the power of the stars to increase the power of his attacks.

The Pantheon
is the Targonian Celestial Aspect of War, a being that (uncommon among Aspects) completely possessed the body of the current host, Atreus. After the death of the Aspect at the hands of
Aatrox
, Atreus would be freed from the aspects control. He would briefly be controlled by a resurrected Aspect during the events of the Ruination. Atreus resents The Warrior for his arrogance towards mortals, an opinion that has shaped most of Atreus' viepoints towards god-like beings. He now prides in the power and resilience of mortals, and opposes the greater powers that threaten the world.

Aatrox
[
