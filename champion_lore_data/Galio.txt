The Colossus

Commissioned by King Jarvan I around
292 AN - 349 AN
, the master craftsman Durand sculpted
Galio
to stand guard over the capital. In battle, the statue would be transported to the front lines to neutralize enemy mages. At the Battle of the
Greenfang Mountains
, the magical onslaught of warmages known as the Arcane Fist infused Galio with enough energy to awaken for the first time. He fought alongside Demacian soldiers, destroying the enemy force before the magic faded and he returned to inert stone. While unable to move, his mind remained awake, longing to relive that moment.

A Hero Wakes

For decades, Galio would remain dormant, aware but unable to move without a strong magical presence. He was often transported to battlefields, only to return without awakening. One day, during a clash with
Freljordian barbarians
, he spotted a titanic chained beast and felt his old excitement. A sorcerer’s devastating magic finally stirred him to life. Galio charged into the fray, smashing siege engines and challenging the monstrous creature. Though he relished the fight, the cries of his Demacian soldiers drew him away. He crushed the enemy mage, routing the invaders, but the loss of magical energy sent him back into dormancy, questioning why he possessed no magic of his own.

Flesh and Stone

Years later,
Luxanna Crownguard
, a thirteen-year-old noble girl hiding her dangerous light magic, fled her home in fear of discovery. She wandered into the palace gardens and approached the Galio monument, accidentally awakening him with her magic. The two formed a warm, if brief, companionship: Galio marveled at her light, and Lux delighted in his protection. Their time together was cut short when Lux slipped away from the colossus to evade the
annullers
, yet Galio soon found her again, rescuing her from a band of armed men in the woods. They shared a peaceful moment watching the sunrise before she returned home, where her mother had summoned an annuller. Lux refused to be “cured,” choosing to live with her magic in secret.

For almost a decade after
Lux's
magic reawakened him, he was summoned to aid her,
Garen
and other Demacian soldiers at a northern fortress in fighting off
Sylas
and his
Winter's Claw
allies.

Appearance

Galio is takes the appearance of a large muscular gargoyle, with wing motifs reminiscent to the
winged sister
during Demacia's early years. His body is mostly made of petricite, which is of a white marble-like color, Some gold elements are present around his body, giving him a regal appearance.

Personality

Galio, when active, has a cheerful personality, always eager to help people in need, as well as fight whenever called upon. He has no particular fondness for most mages, as most of his encounters with them are from opposing armies.

Abilities

Magic Absorption:
Galio's gigantic petricite body can absorb magic in a large area around him, preventing collateral damage by magic. He seems to be capable of controlling this ability, given that
Lux
seems to be able to use magic when around him.
Immense Strength:
Thanks to his enormous size, Galio has immense strength, capable to destroy entire armies and create powerful shockwaves by clapping his wings.
Invulnerability:
Galio is particularly indestructible, and can resist massive amount of physical attacks that very few could survive.
Flight:
Despite his massive size, Galio can fly with no problem. It is unclear how much the wing-like construction on his back contributes to his flying abilities.
Brawler:
During his time as the protector of Demacia, Galio has learned several hand-to-hand combat moves, which he utilizes with his immense strength and durability.

As most Demacians do, the Crownguards make an annual pilgrimage to visit Galio on the Memorial Road. This is how he first became aware of
Lux
, reacting to the growing presence of the light magic within her each year ever since she was a toddler. Galio sees Lux as the only mage he likes and has become a sort of guardian to her. Lux is apparently the first person to have an actual conversation with him. She was 13-years-old at the time.
