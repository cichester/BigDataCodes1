Early Life
[

|
edit source
]

Not much is known about LeBlanc's early life, except that she was born over a thousand years ago and was uniquely skilled at magic, specializing in illusions.

Reign of the Iron Revenant
[
edit
|
edit source
]


During the reign of the Iron Revenant
Mordekaiser
, LeBlanc was one of the many acolytes who served his empire of death. Having learned of Sahn-Uzal's conquests, LeBlanc believed there was no one her master would not use or sacrifice should it benefit him, and when Mordekaiser raised an army of undead shadows from his past, she watched as he tortured and enslaved his Bringer of Ruin,
Atakhan
, even though the
demon
had been a dutiful servant in his previous life. In the following years, LeBlanc witnessed untold death and destruction as Mordekaiser laid waste to the continent of
Valoran
. His reign lasted for centuries, until at the height of Mordekaiser's power, she noticed a brewing unrest among the fractured Noxii barbarian tribes, who had long suffered as a result of the Revenant's tyrannical rule.
[

]
LeBlanc met with the fiendish blood mage
Vladimir
, who was considered a god by these barbarians, and when she gave him an offer they feasted as equals in his home. Here, the pale sorceress and barbarian god wove magic so dark that the wine at their table soured, and the roses withered, vibrant red turning to black.
[
3
]
As the Noxii alliance marched on Mordekaiser's
Immortal Bastion
, LeBlanc pledged to neutralize the source of her master's dark power at its source, cutting him from the well of death that fueled his empire. When they confronted him, LeBlanc and Vladimir cast Mordekaiser from the material realm by severing the anchors of his soul from his armor,
[
4
]
which was later hidden in a secret place far beneath his own fortress.
[
5
]
LeBlanc and Vladimir also managed to seal the Revenant's demons, Atakhan and
Tybaulk
, before hiding them away as well.
[
2
]
[
6
]
The Noxii tribes were victorious, and the barbarians laid claim to the Immortal Bastion, believing its wicked power had been locked away for good. Unbeknownst to them, remnants of Mordekaiser's magic still stirred, as LeBlanc had seized her master's dark arcane secrets for herself.
[
2
]
To hide her deception, she too eventually vanished into the pages of history, and by the time the ancient
Rune Wars
devastated and wiped out nearly every civilization, nearly all records of LeBlanc's existence had been burned away, with her only traces being old, ephemeral legends that a pale sorceress once helped the Noxii tribes defeat Mordekaiser.

Plotting in the Shadows of Noxus
[
edit
|
edit source
]

In the centuries that followed the ancient Rune Wars, LeBlanc and Vladimir recruited many into the order of the
Black Rose
, which grew into a cabal of the most powerful mages in all of Runeterra. The Black Rose grew its influence to further the interests of those who wielded such powerful magic, with its rank-and-file members among the greedy, powerless nobility being nothing more than pawns to their ends. The barbarians who had survived the Rune Wars forged a new empire,
Noxus
, in the shadow of the
Immortal Bastion
. As Noxus began their conquests, under LeBlanc's leadership, the Black Rose manipulated its nobility, its military, and even its throne from the shadows, and were secretly responsible for a large number of the empire's most significant military campaigns. Eventually, LeBlanc extended her influence well beyond Noxus, sending her dark magic to twist every corner of Runeterra, including the
Freljord
,
Targon
, and the deserts of
Shurima
. LeBlanc's dark political games pushed Runeterra to the brink of all-out war on numerous occasions, always done secretly and in the name of furthering the cabal's interests.
One of the nobles who joined the Black Rose was named
Lady Elise
. LeBlanc, seeing in her a certain cunning and ruthlessness, would approach the poisoned, bedridden woman with the offer of joining the Black Rose. In an attempt to prove her worth, Elise would set sail to the
Shadow Isles
in order to find an esteemed item for the cabal, only to be mutated into a half-spider creature under the control of
Vilemaw
, the Spider King. LeBlanc saw this as a opportunity to travel to the Isles in safety, and she would give Elise acolytes for sacrifice and in turn she would bring powerful artifacts from the isles.
One such event secretly orchestrated by LeBlanc happened during the first war between Noxus and
Demacia
, where the Hand of Noxus
Sion
charged into battle and caught King Jarvan I, tearing the crown from his head and killing him with his bare hands. LeBlanc used her magic to disguise herself as a Demacian soldier, blocking the army from rescuing their king until both he and Sion were dead on the ground. Sion was made into a hero of Noxus, his legacy immortalized as one who gave his life for the purpose and glory of empire, and his statue becoming a symbol for all Noxians to aspire towards.

Reign of Boram Darkwill
[

Resurrection of Sion
[
edit
|
edit source
]

During the final days of the
First Demacian-Noxian War
, LeBlanc supported the rise of a new Grand General,
Boram Darkwill
, and after he took the throne, the Black Rose spearheaded the resurrection of the empire's long-dead hero
Sion
, even though his body had been entombed in a statue to honor him for all time. Darkwill could not refuse a gift from his mysterious allies, but upon witnessing how uncontrollable the undead warrior had become, Darkwill changed his mind, ordering Sion to be sealed back up.
[
8
]
Eventually, Darkwill began to refuse the Black Rose's counsel, and LeBlanc realized the Grand General had grown wary of her influence. To regain control, LeBlanc orchestrated a plot to fake her own death, manipulating the young nobleman
Jericho Swain
into revealing the cabal and having it appear that the most prominent conspirators, including LeBlanc herself, were executed by his hand.

Medarda Civil War
[

edit source
]

Main article:
Ambessa: Chosen of the Wolf

As part of her plot to control the Great Houses of Noxus, LeBlanc set her sights on the powerful
House Medarda
, sending two of her best mages—the
Solari
Rudo and
hemomancer
Inyene—to install Ta'Fik Medarda as her puppet in Menelik's place. LeBlanc also ordered Inyene to begin experimenting with a technique called "magical transference" in a desert laboratory south of
Tereshni
, which attempted to replicate the tattoos of the legendary rune mage
Ryze
. Inyene began their flesh rune research by raising an army of rune-soldiers for Ta'Fik to defeat his rival in the succession:
Ambessa Medarda
. When this task was completed, Inyene began work on
Nullification
, which would empower one mage at the expense of another, who would be left in a powerless, catatonic state. Inyene's experiments were so brutal that Rudo abandoned the Black Rose and vowed to destroy the project, joining forces with Ambessa to defeat Ta'Fik and Inyene.
LeBlanc and her spies kept tabs on Ambessa as she was in the
capital
seeking Darkwill's support, and again when she fought Ta'Fik's rune-soldiers in
Rokrund
. During this time, their attention fell upon a young mage in Ambessa's army,
Rell Canwell
, whose powers of
ferromancy
were discovered when she suffered a near-death encounter against a
basilisk
. After Ambessa's forces defended the city using Rell's new abilities, LeBlanc disguised herself as Ambessa and infiltrated the citadel, kidnapping the girl without a trace. When Ambessa had finally won the conflict and destroyed Inyene's research notes, LeBlanc confronted her in the desert, declaring that her efforts were futile, as the Rose had already made copies and were going to turn Rell into a weapon to make up for the deaths of Inyene and Rudo. Since LeBlanc could not control the Medarda clan, she decided to destroy it instead, leaving Ambessa alive so she could watch her family legacy crumble around her. At around the same time, the Black Rose began experimenting on Rell, forcing her into combat with other young mages. The girl swore vengeance on her captors. The Black Rose welcomed her into their ranks.

Invasion of Ionia
[
edit
|
edit source
]

After many years of planning, Darkwill finally launched his invasion of
Ionia
in 984 AN, which was long-considered his greatest ambition in a list of the empire's other conquests. Still, as he grew older and more paranoid, Darkwill was approached again by LeBlanc and seduced by her promises to extend his life, and LeBlanc once again had control of the throne. She and Darkwill sent
General Swain
, the very same nobleman she had manipulated all those years ago, to die on the battlefields of
Ionia
, and though he survived the Placidium he had also lost an arm and was cast out of the military in disgrace.
However, Swain returned one day, for within the Immortal Bastion had lied a power that many had tried and failed to obtain: the power of
Raum
. Swain had found a way to use Raum to his own benefit, and became empowered by the knowledge, powers, and restored physical form that it gave him. Though his coup took years to plan, Swain and his allies managed to overthrow and kill Darkwill in a single night, after which Swain claimed the title of Grand General and established the
Trifarix
in Darkwill's place.
[
9
]
Swain's rise to power concerned LeBlanc, as he could not be easily corrupted nor manipulated like Darkwill had been. To reassert her control over Noxus, she made plans to destroy the new Grand General, working to assassinate him many times over the next few years.

Feud with Ambessa Medarda

Arcane

Death of Kino
[
edit
|
edit source
]

LeBlanc's feud with Ambessa continued for many years after the death of Ta'Fik, and as the warlord continued to lose her allies and territory, she became increasingly desperate to uproot the cabal once and for all.
[
11
]
Ambessa's son,
Kino
, became deeply entangled in the Black Rose's web while investigating the death of his
father
,
[
12
]
and he uncovered evidence in
Basilich
which revealed that Rudo and Ambessa had an affair decades prior. The affair led to a
child
who inherited Rudo's magical abilities, and believing that child to be Kino, the cabal kidnapped him. It became quickly apparent that Kino was not Rudo's child, and when Ambessa left Kino to die instead of saving him, LeBlanc killed Ambessa's son. With no allies left that she could turn to, Ambessa set sail for
Piltover
.
[
13
]
[
14
]

Conspiracy in Piltover
[
edit
|
edit source
]

LeBlanc's agent in the region, the guild merchant
Amara
, attempted to assassinate Ambessa when they learned she was after
hextech
weapons to avenge her son's death. The attempt failed, and the Black Rose later kidnapped Ambessa's daughter, the disowned heir
Mel
, to determine if she was the child they were searching for.
[
11
]
As a test of Mel's potential, LeBlanc trapped Mel in a special chamber called an Oculorum and guided her through the test, disguising herself as Kino. Eventually, Mel saw through the illusion and attacked LeBlanc, and when LeBlanc was about to kill her, Mel's powers manifested in a radiant burst of light.
[
13
]
After this, LeBlanc congratulated Mel, continuing to hide her true face behind illusions as she revealed the depths of her mother's deception, urging her to save Piltover from its destruction at her mother's hands. LeBlanc then recruited Mel into the Black Rose's ranks, gifting her a special amulet that could summon her at a moment's notice.
[
15
]
Mel cooperated with LeBlanc during the battle at the Hexgate, and after Mel and
Caitlyn Kiramman
managed to strip Ambessa of her
kaenic rookern
, LeBlanc used her
magic
to ensnare and kill Ambessa. However, Mel suddenly betrayed LeBlanc, using her powers to expel the sorceress's influence from the city, after which Mel took charge of Ambessa's warbands and returned to Noxus.
[
16
]
After Ambessa's death, LeBlanc laid a black rose on a pedestal with the
Medarda
crest, marking the final end of her old rival.

Summoning of Atakhan
[

Main article:
Welcome to Noxus

After facing an unexpected turn of events in
Piltover
, LeBlanc and
Vladimir
began planning their next move. Vladimir was interested in
Mel's
arrival in
Noxus
and suggested focusing their efforts on the "opportunity" she presented them. However, LeBlanc had become convinced that what had occurred in Piltover meant they had "bolder" in their next move,
[
17
]
and despite Vladimir's reservations, she set her sights on something far more dangerous: a
Darkin
weapon.
[
18
]
To locate this ancient relic, LeBlanc required the knowledge of an equally ancient being, so together with Vladimir, she took the helm of
Atakhan
and set the
demon
free from its thousand-year imprisonment. The demon, driven by its baseless hunger for carnage and suffering, was given distorted visions of its past, roaming Runeterran battlefields until at last, it ended up in the grassy field where General Khatash-Li and Atakhan had fought in the distant past, with the same table and
deck of cards
he had been playing with his king,
Sahn-Uzal
.
[
2
]
LeBlanc disguised herself as a wounded stranger and played the game with Atakhan, speaking to it to reunite its old and fractured memories. She gifted the demon sigils to aid it in the game, which were secretly a means to free it from its baseless hunger and force the demon under the
Black Rose's
control. At the final eclipse, Atakhan won the game, but at the cost of its freedom as LeBlanc revealed herself, entrapping it with chains and shattering the illusion around them to reveal their true location: a tiled white room.
LeBlanc and Vladimir told the demon that it would be set free again if it revealed the location of the Darkin weapon. Though it was enraged, Atakhan obeyed the sorceress, painting an inky image onto the wall
[
18
]
which revealed an
Ionian
gateway into the
Spirit Realm
. LeBlanc was eager to claim her prize, but Vladimir was more reluctant, believing they lacked the means, as they both had no "host" and the new
Grand General
was unlikely to agree to another invasion of the region. Still, LeBlanc believed they could acquire the Darkin without the might of
Noxus
, and after chaining the demon once again, they made preparations to head to Ionia.

Tifalenji
to return
Riven's
runic blade back to her, threatening to take her life if she didn't bring it back.

Daredevil Impulse

On the same year, LeBlanc took the form of a tattoo artist and kept an eye on
Samira
. Later, she revealed herself to
Captain Indari
, Samira's mentor, and declared the
Black Rose
had plans for her.

Main article:
Garen: First Shield

In 997 AN, one year after the death of
King Jarvan III
, the relationship between Demacia and
Nockmirch
lacked communication thanks to the turmoil of the
Mage Rebellion
. LeBlanc took advantage of this and created a clone of
Garen's
great-uncle Hargold in order to pressure Lord Eldwyn to side with Noxus. Her efforts ended up failing and Nockmirch renewed its truce with Demacia.

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

LeBlanc is a slender sorceress with dark long hair, golden eyes and paper-like white skin, hence her moniker
The Pale Woman.
She wears a black, red-trimmed dress which is cut down the middle, along with a decorative golden chestplate, heels, earrings, and a headpiece that points up above her head. On her face, LeBlanc wears golden makeup underneath her eyes which resemble tear marks. LeBlanc wears a seemingly living cape that hovers just behind her shoulders, which has a golden reflective surface on the inside which resembles a shattered mirror, and dark colors on the back surrounding the golden sigil of the
Black Rose
. The cape has a tall collar that extends above her head. She carries a dark, glowing red staff in her right hand, which has a dark Black Rose sigil floating directly above it.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

LeBlanc is a deceptive individual, often using her sorcery to trick, confuse, or convince people into serving her and the interests of the Black Rose. LeBlanc is also clever, using all manner of methods to serve the interests of her and the Black Rose. Her ultimate goal is to have control of Noxus, whether publicly or by proxy.
Although she seeks the striving of herself and her coven, LeBlanc never takes the spotlight of her schemes. Instead, she manipulates others to do the dirty work for her, as she convinces them through their little struggles as she sees the big picture.

Abilities
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Master Sorceress
: While it is unknown if she was born with magical abilities or learned the magic arts through training, LeBlanc can harness powerful magic capable of creating
blasts of energy
,
energy constructs
, and
item enchantments
. She also has an extensive knowledge of the arcane and the nature of magic itself, which helped her in noticing that
Rell
had the right type of magic that could stop
Mordekaiser
when he returns.
Illusion Magic
: Illusions are LeBlanc's signature magic. She is capable of casting illusions, clones, changing appearances and being at multiple places at once. This magic gave her notoriety and the nickname
The Deceiver.
Teleportation
: LeBlanc is capable of teleportation from one place to another.
Clone Creation
: LeBlanc is able of creating mirror images of herself that act independently but on her command. She is also capable of creating clones of other people as well.
Shapeshifter
: LeBlanc can take on the appearance of others, seemingly at will. When she encountered
Ambessa Medarda
in the desert, she took the forms of important figures in her life, including her cousin Ta'Fik, her protégé
Rell
, and her lieutenant
Rictus
.
[
12
]
Years later, she did the same to Ambessa's daughter
Mel
, taking the forms of Ambessa,
Kino
Jayce
,
Elora
,
Lady Mion
, and Mel herself.
Immortality
: LeBlanc is millennia old, being around before the foundation of Noxus.
Guile
: LeBlanc is a master in political intrigue and has changed the course of civilizations. She deceived
Mordekaiser
and locked him away in the
spirit realm
, and planned
Swain's
death on the Ionian battlefields by manipulating
Boram Darkwill
.
Magic Staff
: Like some certain mages, LeBlanc has a staff with which she better channels her magical powers. Her staff is tall, black, and red, with the sigil of the
Black Rose
floating above the top.

Relations
[

]

Mordekaiser
[
edit
|
edit source
]


LeBlanc was familiar with Mordekaiser's past life as
Sahn-Uzal
, and when he returned centuries later as the Iron Revenant, she was forced into his service as part of his inner circle. LeBlanc witnessed the resurrection of Mordekaiser's fallen soldiers from his past, which included the demon
Atakhan
, and she watched fearfully with his other servants as he brutally tortured and enslaved the demon back under his will. In the following years, LeBlanc witnessed his brutal conquests against the Noxii tribes, and when they decided to unite against him, LeBlanc sensed opportunity and joined forces with them and
Vladimir
to steal her master's power for herself.
[
2
]
Unbeknownst to LeBlanc, Mordekaiser had always planned on her betrayal, as he had never fully trusted her to begin with.
[
4
]
LeBlanc hid Mordekaiser's armor in a place deep beneath the
Immortal Bastion
, where she plans for his eventual return and always seeks out new power so that she may destroy him once and for all.
[
5
]

Atakhan
and
Tybaulk
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Atakhan and Tybaulk were
Mordekaiser's
personal hound demons who served in his second conquest.
[
6
]
Having learned the myths of Sahn-Uzal, LeBlanc was aware of Atakhan's past service to Mordekaiser, as well as that of its human host, Khatash-Li. She later witnessed Atakhan's brutal enslavement after Mordekaiser's return from death.
[
2
]
After Mordekaiser's defeat, LeBlanc and
Vladimir
also defeated and imprisoned his demons, which they hoped to bind in service to the
Black Rose
. Although Tybaulk escaped the Rose and has since been tamed by
Annie Hastur
, Atakhan remains bound to LeBlanc's will, despite its wish to be free once more.

Veigar
[
edit
|
edit source
]

LeBlanc and Veigar were both forced to work for
Mordekaiser
as part of his inner circle.
[
20
]
She finds it somewhat tasteless that Veigar aspires to be like their former master, believing Mordekaiser to be an unworthy role model.

Black Rose
[
edit
|
edit source
]

LeBlanc is the Matron of the Black Rose, whose members include
Cassiopeia
,
Elise
and
Vladimir
.
While originally treating each other as equals, LeBlanc's relationship with
Vladimir
has soured over time. LeBlanc has been waiting centuries for Vladimir to die so she can take his power away for herself.
LeBlanc tasks
Elise
with bearing magical artifacts for her from the
Shadow Isles
and in exchange, she gives Elise acolytes to offer as sacrifices to
Vilemaw
.
Sion
was resurrected under the help of the Black Rose, likely at LeBlanc's command.

Boram Darkwill
[
edit
|
edit source
]

LeBlanc assisted Boram Darkwill's rise to Grand Generalship, but when he refused the counsel of her hand-picked advisors, she orchestrated a plot to fake her own death, manipulating
Jericho Swain
into revealing the Black Rose and its members so that he would publicly execute them.
[
21
]
Darkwill believed LeBlanc to be dead after this, and as he grew complacent with his victory she slowly continued to manipulate him, eventually regaining his favor after promising to extend his mortal lifespan. LeBlanc's manipulation of Darkwill made him her "puppet emperor," which continued until his eventual death at Swain's hands.

Jericho Swain
[
edit
|
edit source
]

As a means to solidify her control over
Darkwill
, LeBlanc manipulated the young nobleman Jericho Swain into revealing and executing the
Black Rose
and its members, including his own parents, as a means to fake her own death. Swain killed LeBlanc by his own hand during a high society waltz, and for many years, he believed she was dead.
[
21
]
In the later years of Darkwill's life, Darkwill had fallen under LeBlanc's manipulations and he sent Swain to meet his death at the
Battle of the Placidium
in
Ionia
. Some of the LeBlancs refused to eliminate him for goods, believing that he was no longer a threat to their schemes. This allowed Swain to survive the encounter, which led to him receiving a vision from the
ravens
, where he learned about LeBlanc's survival and Darkwill's betrayal. After Swain's takeover of Noxus and the establishment of the
Trifarix
, he and LeBlanc have become political rivals, with Swain ordering assassinations of Darkwill loyalists (many of whom had connections to the Black Rose)
[
22
]
and LeBlanc ordering assassinations on Swain himself,
[
10
]
spending all of her time (which is multiplied by her many
doppelgangers
) plotting his destruction.
[
23
]

Ambessa Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Ambessa was locked in a feud with the
Black Rose
for some time, and as a result of their feud, LeBlanc killed Ambessa's son,
Kino
. Desperate and vengeful, Ambessa set out to acquire
hextech
weapons to destroy the Black Rose, but LeBlanc foresaw an approaching
calamity
that would destroy
Piltover
as a result of Ambessa's actions. LeBlanc tried many times to kill Ambessa, first using assassins and eventually enlisting the help of Ambessa's daughter,
Mel
. LeBlanc did not have a high opinion of Ambessa, believing she was prideful for letting her son die and "blinded" by a "thirst for legacy" to the destructive consequences of her actions.
[
15
]
LeBlanc eventually killed Ambessa when Mel and
Caitlyn Kiramman
stole her
kaenic rookern
, taunting her for how much trouble she had caused, despite not being a
mage
.
[
16
]

Mel Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]


As the hidden daughter of a powerful
Black Rose
mage, Mel was kept a secret from LeBlanc until long after Rudo's death. When she learned of her existence, LeBlanc believed that Rudo's child belonged to the Black Rose and began looking for her. During her search, LeBlanc killed Mel's brother
Kino
and her friend
Elora
, whom she treated as nothing more than collateral damage. Then, she kidnapped Mel and trapped her in an Oculorum to test her abilities. LeBlanc accompanied Mel throughout the test, disguised as Kino, until Mel saw through the illusion and broke free with her magic, completing the test.
[
13
]
After this, LeBlanc spoke to Mel while donning a number of forms—Kino,
Ambessa
,
Lady Mion
, and Mel herself—who were all people important to Mel's past. LeBlanc did not reveal her true face to Mel, nor did she introduce herself by name. Instead, she congratulated Mel on unlocking her abilities as a
mage
and attempted to recruit her into her "new family".
LeBlanc was manipulative of Mel, mixing in excuses and lies as she shifted blame away from herself for Kino's murder. In turn, Mel did not trust LeBlanc, immediately pinpointing her as an illusionist while claiming her abilities as an empath made LeBlanc "afraid" of her.
[
15
]
Still, LeBlanc and Mel managed to work together to stop the approaching
calamity
Ambessa was about to unleash, and at the battle at the Hexgate, LeBlanc successfully killed Ambessa after Mel summoned her using the special amulet. After Ambessa was defeated, Mel turned on LeBlanc, calling her a "Deceiver" and destroying her shadowy form.
[
16
]

Samira
[
edit
|
edit source
]

LeBlanc has a special interest in Samira, believing her to be a potential asset to their organization. Samira's instructor,
Captain Indari
, is a secret member of the
Black Rose
acting on LeBlanc's orders.
[
24
]

Rell Canwell
[
edit
|
edit source
]

When Rell learned she was a mage after a near-death encounter with a
basilisk
, LeBlanc and her agents became interested in weaponizing her potential. LeBlanc arrived personally in
Rokrund
—disguised as
Ambessa Medarda
—to deceive and kidnap Rell, who was summarily trained and experimented on to enhance her powers of ferromancy to be used as a weapon for the
Black Rose
's ends.
[
12
]
Rell swore vengeance on the Rose for what they did to her and the other subjects. She eventually managed to escape, and LeBlanc has been hunting her down ever since.

Riven Konte
[

Riven's
blade
was enchanted by LeBlanc herself. LeBlanc later sent a small warband that included Riven's old team mates to bring her and the blade back to Noxus.

Demacia

LeBlanc may be plotting a war between
Demacia
and
Noxus
at the moment, with either one of her Black Rose spies or even a clone of herself having encountered
Garen
and
Quinn
in the process.
[

It is implied that LeBlanc was involved in the capture of
Jarvan IV
by the Noxian army, based on the flavor text of
