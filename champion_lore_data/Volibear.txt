Volibear is a massive bear-like creature who can stand on two legs or four. He has glowing blue eyes and his body is covered in shaggy white fur, gradually turning dark gray at his hands and feet. All of his digits feature claws seemingly made of dark blue ice. The same ice is used in runic inscriptions embedded in his upper arms and over his left eye, as well as lightning bolt patterns on his outer lower torso. It also coats his outer thighs like armored plates. The fur on his head and neck is fashioned into a loose ponytail in the back and two long braids which are draped in front of his shoulders and decorated with metal ornaments, also featuring glowing blue runes. He also wears a long, dangling piercing on his right ear.
Even at rest, parts of Volibear seem to glow softly with blue magic. When unleashing his full power, however, his appearance can change drastically. Jagged, icy spikes protrude from his back, the blue ice on his body glows white, and he becomes surrounded by dark storm clouds and crackling lightning.
