Early life

Shyvana was born to
Yvva
, a powerful fire dragon. Prior to hatching, her egg was captured by a mage, and Yvva could not get it back. The mage kept the egg, and it hatched, but instead of being born as a baby dragon, Shyvana was born as a human with unnatural, pale blue skin. The mage grew fond of the little girl and decided to raise her as his daughter in secret. As Shyvana grew, she discovered more and more of her latent abilities. The mage did everything he could to help her control her budding draconic magic and, by her adolescence, she was able to transform between her human form and that of a powerful dragon at will.

Contemporary history

Yvva, who had a psychic connection with her daughter, managed to track her down. In her rage, she burned down the entire town Shyvana called home. Shyvana hid amidst some ruins, watching helplessly as her mother rained fire from above. The mage himself did not escape the flames. Shyvana watched on as he succumbed to the inferno and, when her mother was finished, she came out of hiding, retrieved his charred corpse, and gave him a simple burial. She mourned her once-captor turned adoptive father—slain by her very mother—alone.
Fearful that her mother might return, Shyvana took to living on the move, never staying in the same place twice. One day, wandering through a forest, she picked up the aroma of fresh, human blood among the scent of trees and fauna. Following her nose, she found a wounded warrior on the verge of death. Transforming into her draconic form, she took the unconscious man to Wrenwall castle, saving his life. There, she found that this man was none other than Prince
Jarvan
IV, sole son and heir apparent to the throne of Demacia. The soldiers of the castle looked upon Shyvana with disgust because of her magical nature, but for her valor in saving the prince, she was treated with respect. She would later reflect that her time spent there was the most serene time of her life.
However, serenity never lasts and, in her peace, Shyvana had forgotten her pursuer. Yvva found her there, among the Demacians, and Shyvana knew what would surely follow. The soldiers quickly sent the civilians inside the fortress to protect them and, knowing her mother's quarry was her alone, Shyvana prepared to flee. Prince Jarvan intercepted Shyvana's attempted escape, forcing the half-dragon to tearfully tell him the truth: This dragon was none other than her mother, and so long as Shyvana herself was here, both him and his people were in danger. Jarvan, never having forgotten the kindness Shyvana had showed him by saving his life, swore then that he would never abandon her, nor allow her to face her mother alone.  Moved, Shyvana accepted the offer of aid, and prepared to face Yvva with the might of Demacia by her side.
As Yvva appeared on the horizon, the castle archers began distracting her with arrows. She sprayed a burst of fire on the castle in retaliation, heavily wounding the archer line. Just as she let her guard down, Shyvana sprinted out of the palace and leapt into the air, transformed into dragon in mid-flight. Shyvana and Yvva fought a fierce and gruesome battle. Shyvana had never used her abilities in such a way before. Remembering the people she was protecting, and those who were hurt protecting her, Shyvana grabbed her mother's head, and broke Yvva's neck on a castle wall, closing the battle.
Following the confrontation with her mother, Prince Jarvan IV honored Shyvana's bravery, and asked whether she would journey with him to Demacia proper. Shyvana wholeheartedly accepted. Though Shyvana was afraid that she would be distrusted due to her nature, these proved to be unfounded: The people of Demacia welcomed her as a hero, and Prince Jarvan offered her a place within the elite group known as the Dragonguard, so she might protect this land from other dangerous dragons like Yvva.

The Mageseeker
[

During the rebellion of the magicians,
Jarvan IV
confronted
Sylas
. The two had an arduous battle, and Sylas nearly bested the prince, but, just before Sylas could finish the job, Shyvana descended from the sky and disrupted the battle, prepared to honor her role as
Dragonguard
.
Sylas faced the two of them, and a fierce fight ensued. A furious Shyvana implored Jarvan to withdraw, and, trusting her judgment, he listened. With the prince out of the way, Shyvana was free to transform into her draconic form, ready to crush Sylas once and for all. But she underestimated the Kingslayer, and he bested her. Wounded, she reverted to her human form and plummeted to the ground. Sylas moved in for the kill, and Prince Jarvan intercepted him, risking his own life to protect not merely a guard, not merely a woman, but a being of pure magic. Quick on the uptake, Sylas noted their connection, and accused the crown prince of hypocrisy. While Sylas rotted in prison for his magic, the prince had fallen in love with a being composed of it. Seeing how injured his opponents were, Sylas once again moved in to kill Jarvan, but Shyvana, with what forces she still possessed, conjured a circle of fire around the two of them, cutting Sylas off. In the end, Sylas had no choice but to flee, but not before swearing that he would kill the prince and his beloved dragon. Slipping into unconsciousness, Shyvana collapsed into Jarvan's arms.
Following the battle, Shyvana had no choice but to leave Demacia due to the countless rules against wizards and magical beings. As he once had, Jarvan tried to convince her not to leave, and she suggested that they leave together, and start a new life. He told her what she already knew: He couldn't do it. Before she left, she implored him not to allow his father's ruthlessness to pass on to the kingdom Jarvan would rule, but Jarvan told her that it was too late for that. With a sad smile, she replied that no transformation lasts forever, and wished him good luck. She then jumped from the castle tower and, assuming draconic form, flew away from the castle, though, perhaps, never too far.
After Jarvan disbanded the
Mageseekers
, Shyvana is seen returning from the horizon, finally free to come home.
