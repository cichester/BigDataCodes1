Early life

Kayle and her twin sister
Morgana
were born on Mount Targon during the height of the Rune Wars to
Kilam
and
Mihira
, the current Aspect of Justice. Due to Mihira ascending while pregnant, the sisters were born with a fraction of her celestial power. As the war raged on, Mihira's celestial power began to overshadow her personality and affections as she dedicated more and more of her time to her duties as an aspect. Fearing what Mihira was becoming, as well as the enemies drawn to her light that could be a threat to family, Kilam resolved to take their daughters to safety. He fled Targon with his children and they would sail to the land that would be known as
Demacia
.

Becoming Demacia's Winged Protector

The sisters grew to having distinct and clashing personalities. While Morgana was empathizing with the newly arrived refugees, Kayle argued about laws of the settlement because she knew the laws were meant to protect people.
One day, Mihira's sword would fell from the sky and clash into two. From that moment, feathered wings bursted from the sister's backs and remained, confirming the celestial magic would still remain inside them. In that moment, Kayle felt more connected to her mother than ever. While Morgana resented her gifts, Kayle embraced her new power. One day, the settlement was attacked, and the sisters flew to aid the people of Zeffira. While Kayle was busy dealing with the frontline attack, Morgana learned of a hidden wave of enemies attacking the city and left the frontlines to aid the citizens. After the battle Kayle, for a time, lost trust in her sister for leaving her on the battlefield. Since that day, they were hailed as the Winged Protectors.

Kayle and
Morgana
at the gates of ancient Demacia.

Kayle and Morgana put on their armors and helmets, and stood against an army before the city walls. They easily destroyed the first wave. Sensing the danger approaching in the skies, the Winged Protectors took flight without hesitation and engaged in a deadly battle with
Aatrox
, who managed to possess a new host. Aatrox was too powerful to be defeated physically for the sisters. As the last stand, Morgana left her sword behind, and stood against Aatrox, binding him with her chains of dark flame. Taking Morgana's sword, Kayle empowered her wings and sword with celestial flames and burned the mortal body of him, sealing Aatrox within his own blade.

Battle of the Winged Sisters and Departure

Warriors flocked to Kayle's banner at Silvermere's Peak, where she founded a judicator order to enforce the law, and hunted down rebels and reavers with equal fervor. Kayle allowed Morgana to rehabilitate wrongdoers who appeared humble enough to admit their guilt. However, some people in the Judicator Order and especially Ronas, one of Kayle's ardent disciples, decided to arrest Morgana and her followers when Kayle was bringing justice upon a distant kingdom ruled by a cruel, unrighteous king. In an attempt to protect her followers, Morgana conjured magical chains of fire and bound him until he fell dead. His death led to an outbreak of violent riot in the settlement.

Morgana
fighting in the sky above Demacia.

When Kayle returned to city and found out what happened, she became enraged and with her power she summoned divine fire to punish the sinners in the city and Ronas' killer. As Kayle divine fire lit the city from above, Morgana flew up to meet her, giving Kayle ultimatum that if she want smite this people, she should start from her sister.  The two dueled in the sky, each matching the other’s terrible blows and striking the buildings beneath them to rubble, and killing innocent people without realize. It seemed that one of them was eventually going to win but Morgana faltered because she and Kayle heard their father's screams and stopped fighting. Their father was mortally wounded, Morgana hurled her sword at Kayle through tears, and plunged to the surface like a meteorite to cradle her father.
She took her dying father in her arms, and in a sea of tears, cursed her heavenly inheritance for the destruction around her. A moment later, Kayle landed too, and between sobs Morgana asked her if the purification of mortals by smiting included her father. Kayle kept silent, grabbed Morgana's sword and thought about senseless violence that overtaken the city this day. Сrying because of loss, she soared into the heavens and flew to Mount Targon to find her mother, and swore that she would not allow emotions to dominate her anymore.

Journey to Targon Prime

She left Demacia to stand at her mother's side, and to seek for perfect, celestial clarity on Targon. Even though she has been absent from Demacia for many centuries, she has inspired Demacia's culture, law, and architecture. Many pray to the Protector in times of chaos, and hope that she might return, some pray that such a day will never come.
While spending time at Targon Prime, she met
Mihira
,  the current Aspect of Justice and her mother. With time spent on Targon, she seems to become more moderate towards emotions and mortality and stopped denying them. She also continue to ascend herself and fight the world-threatening problems if needed. She also seems to help some Shurimans in need of Aspect of Justice's help. At some point she met
Ryze
and spent some time with him, as she calls him her old friend, but the details about it are missing.

Morgana's Searching of Kayle
[

]

For centuries, Morgana has tried to find her sister, and written down her findings on her journal. A
Solari
warrior reported a sighting of a winged creature on the peaks of the mountain, ascending higher. A wind mage said that a bright flame streaked through the air, spinning away faster and faster. A Demacian noble was convinced that the Winged Protector was still alive, so he sent out rider to track her. After decades, the riders found a single white feather beneath Targon. A
Lunari
child, in the middle of the night, said that he saw a winged ghost, flying around the mountain. Yet, his mother did not believe him.
Many centuries passed, Morgana heard a voice. A lonely, so distant prayer. She had no idea where it came from, but she was so sure that Kayle was praying to her. However, her prayers remained unanswered.

Appearance

Kayle is a slim and relatively muscled woman with pale, slightly tanned skin, short cyan hair with a bang on the right side, burning sun-gold eyes with white pupils and pointy ears. She has four wings on her back and two wings on her waist that vary in cyan blue and light gold.  She was ascended between her twenties and thirties, so her aging has stopped since then.
Kayle's clothing consists of a golden armor  that covers most of her body and brown clothes. Kayle wore a helmet that covered her face when she was the Winged Protector, but after her journey to Targon and her ascension into a more powerful form, she stopped wearing it.

Personality
[

Kayle is an incarnation of justice. While her sister Morgana represents restorative justice and advocates for the repentant, Kayle represents retributive justice and punishes in the fair way possible those who committed crimes without mercy and without taking into account various factors about a person, such as motives, origin, social status, etc. Despite wanting to make the world more just and fighthing to protect innocents and righteous, her lack of empathy towards sinners and zeal makes her quite stoic and cold since she only seeks to punish sinners on an idealistic eye-to-eye level, without forgiveness. As she thinks it necessary for to protect people.
Kayle has big zeal towards bringing of justice and punishing evil in all its forms, no matter if it will be common criminals, tyrants kings or world threats. She is very self-proud of her destiny and occupation as Aspect of Justice and constantly try to transcend even more and receive perfect celestial clarity about justice. While she seems to be cold towards most persons, especially towards sinners, she very much cares about her family and friends.
After duel between her and Morgana, she began rejecting her mortal and emotional parts, as she considered them main reason of this tragedy ever happen, and that became her emotional trauma. With traveling to Targon Prime and spending some time with Mihira, she seems to stop denying her emotions, probably thanks to Mihira's guidance and teachings, who approves Kayle's ideals, but don't want her to lose herself in them. Right now, she is continuing to fight evil, protect innocents and strives for constant improvement and self-ascension, and dreams of building a paradise for the just and glorious, sharing Mihira's ideals.
