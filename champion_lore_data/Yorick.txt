Early Life
[

Yorick grew up in a small fishing village on the edge of the Blessed Isles. He could never find acceptance among his peers, and he eventually learned that he could see the spirits of the dead. While at first he was scared of these spirits, he eventually realized that they were just lost and did not want to hurt him. They wanted to find their way to what lay beyond death, and Yorick helped guide them there. While Yorick was happy to guide them, it was a bittersweet task, as he liked talking to these spirits and helping one reach the beyond meant losing a friend.

Ruination

Tales of Yorick's visions spread and caught the attention of a small religious order of monks called the Brethren of the Dusk. They inducted Yorick into their ranks and gave him a vial of the Waters of Life to wear around his neck, which was common for members of the order. These Waters of Life were magical in nature and could heal someone of almost any injury or ailment. Despite being part of the order, Yorick found himself alone again, shunned by the other monks because he could easily see what they had spent their entire lives trying to understand.
One day, as he was tending to his daily duties in the cemetery, Yorick saw a dark cloud moving across the surface of the Isles and devouring everything in its path. This was the Black Mist, created when a
young king
tried to revive his
dead wife
in the Waters of Life. As the Mist spread, it caused the monks to pull the vials from their necks before consuming their souls and turning their bodies into corpses. Yorick used all of his willpower to not pull the vial from his neck before being consumed by the Mist.
When he awoke, Yorick had been physically changed, and the Isles had been cleansed of all life. The Black Mist reached for him, but recoiled when it tried to reach for the vial around his neck. He realized that the only thing keeping him alive was the last of the Waters of Life around his neck. Despite searching for days, Yorick found no survivors. In his grief, he talked to the spirits surrounding him. They gravitated to his word, and Yorick realized that he could control them. Determined to free the dead spirits on the Isles, Yorick decided to use these powers to end the curse upon the Isles.

While on their quest to defeat
Viego
, the
Sentinels of Light
visited Yorick to ask for help. Seeing that their goals aligned with his, Yorick gave them some of the drops from his vial along with the
Maiden of the Mist
, which was revealed to be a fetter, containing a piece of
Isolde's
's soul.

Yorick is a muscular man with light blue skin and glowing eyes because of his time spent in the Shadow Isles. He wears a dark blue outfit common for those in his position in the Brethren of the Dusk, with no sleeves, fingerless gloves, black shoes, and elongated shoulder pads. Yorick carries with him a large shovel used for digging graves and as a weapon if need be. Around his neck is a glowing light blue vial, containing some of the last drops of the Waters of Life.

Yorick is a quiet and solemn individual. Resigned to his fate long ago, Yorick dutifully digs graves for those who die and have died on the Shadow Isles. While he often talks to the tormented souls around him because of his loneliness and grief and despite caring for the souls, he is aware that they are being controlled by the Mist. His ultimate goal is to find the
Ruined King
and find a way to let everything in the Shadow Isles die, and in his mind, finally be at peace, including himself.

Relations

Illaoi

Illaoi's faith would compel her to kill a man like Yorick, but her recent experiences had given her enough of an open mind to cooperate with the monk. In their philisophical debate,  Yorick argues that helping the dead find peace is more important than banishing them back into the cycle of life. Furthermore, his power to compel the dead would align with the Buhru law of motion, either by commanding the Black Mist or rescuing tormented spirits.

Viego
[

Yorick dreamt of destroying the Ruined King that decimated Helia. This pursuit would drive him to sacrifice his lifelines, such as leaving his seat of power with Illaoi in the first attempt, or giving away the Maiden and his Water of Life to the Sentinels that would succeed in the second attempt. Although, he was disappointed to learn that Viego's banishment has no effect on the Black Mist, and therefore his own predicament.

Sentinels of Light

When the Sentinels met Yorick, he became confident that their strength could stop Viego once and for all. He sacrificed his powers—the Maiden and the Water of Life—knowing that they will be critical for victory.
