The Dreadnought

During
Swain
's uprising, Swain needed a way to keep Urgot out of the Noxian capitol, as he was seen as a threat to Swain's plan. Urgot was subsequently sent to
Zaun
under the pretense of being sent there in order to eliminate a conspiracy against the emperor of Noxus. Urgot was then captured by Chem-Barons and taken to The Dredge, a chemtech prison mine, to be tortured. However, Urgot proved to be resistant to pain, which scared the mine's warden and enboldened Urgot. Urgot had an epiphany, believing Zaun to be great because of its pain, and proceeded to take control of the prison and plunge it into anarchy.


During his reign over the prison, Urgot convinced his fellow prisoners into following him while killing those who didn't. He removed some of his body parts that he deemed "weak" and replaced them with machinery. Eventually, a Noxian agent arrived in the Dredge. He recognized Urgot and begged him to help him escape, to which Urgot killed him. In doing so, he had another epiphany, believing that it was not strength that ruled
Noxus
, but men. Believing men to be weak, he decided that he would plunge the world into chaos in order to cull those that he did not find worthy.
Urgot started a riot which ignited a chemtech vein in the prison, destroying it and shaking Zaun. Many prisoners were killed in the explosion, but many more fleed to the Sump. It was in the Sump where he started gaining more and more followers, preparing to strike again.

Shortly after causing the Dredge to explode, Urgot destroyed the Black Lanes, a market at the heart of Zaun. There, he killed people that worked for a man called Chem-Baron Crimson, along with Crimson himself. While killing Crimson, four adolescents that were part of the Sump Riders gang arrived in the Lanes and saw what was happening. Three of the adolescents died from inhaling toxic fog while Urgot explained to the fourth how all of the men who died, including Chem-Baron Crimson, controlled the city with fear and deserved to die. He let the fourth kid escape, telling him to spread the message about what had happened there.

Child of Zaun

A messenger chosen by Urgot, known as The Voice, had been giving speeches and sermons promoting discontent and anger in the Sumps, The Voice preached about a figure he called 'The Dreadnought' and claimed that he would enact justice unto the Piltovans who put the people in the Sumps. Because of the effects these sermons were having on the people,
Vi
was sent down to the Sumps to investigate. Vi attended one of The Voice's sermons with one of her childhood friends, Roe, and disrupted it, saying that The Voice was just using the people of Zaun to further his own selfish goals. She wasn't able to convince anybody of this, and got ready to leave the Sumps and go back to Piltover, assuming that The Voice and his followers were not much of a danger.
Shortly after this, The Voice, along with his followers, attacked a recently built tower made for Hextech manufacturing. During the attack, Urgot revealed himself to the followers of The Voice. He was revealed to be The Dreadnought that The Voice had spoken about. After deciding that he was not worthy, Urgot killed The Voice. He then released a canister of poisonous gas into the crowd of people that were attacking the tower, calling it a test of strength. Many people died because of this gas, including one of
Vi
's childhood friends, Roe. Those who survived continued the attack on the tower, only to be stopped by
Vi
and
Caitlyn
along with other Piltovan enforcers. After a battle in which many people on both sides were hurt and killed, Urgot's forces were eventually defeated and Urgot was captured and put in prison.




Appearance
[

Urgot is a large figure, standing taller than almost any human. He has six gold and black mechanical legs with green tubes attached to them. These legs give way to a mechanical waist, from which a green tube attaches to a makeshift mask covering Urgot's mouth and nose. He has the upper torso of a muscular man, paler than most because of a large amount of time without seeing Sun in the Dredge, Sumps, and later on, prison. Instead of a right arm, he has a machine gun attached to a piece of machinery where his shoulder would be. The rest of his torso, save for his head, is covered in tattoos.

Personality
[

edit source
]

Urgot is a determined individual, wanting nothing more than to free Zaun from its captors, the chem-barons, and take revenge on Piltover, which has deliberately ignored Zaun, and in his eyes, let it rot while they enjoyed their luxurious lives. While he works tirelessly to free Zaun, he does not consider himself the savior of Zaun, only a personification of its discontent and anger. He believes that Zaun must be ruled by anarchy to reach its true potential, along with the entire world, and that what he considers "the worthy" will be the only ones left standing. Urgot has made this his ultimate goal, and will not stop until he has accomplished it.
