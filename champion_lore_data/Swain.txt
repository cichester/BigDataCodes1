Early life
[

edit source

Jericho Swain was born into an affluent Noxian family, among the established houses that trace shortly after the nation's founding. They were also favored by the emperor of Noxus―
Boram Darkwill
―having been instrumental in his rise to the throne.
Yet House Swain was also among many that hungered for power, and as such were part of a secret cabal called the
Black Rose
. His parents were especially intent on finding some dark power hidden in the depths of the
Immortal Bastion
, that which eluded discovery for many years as it cackled in the darkness like a raven's caw.
The cabal had aided Darkwill's political rise, but in time he rejected their influence thereafter.
LeBlanc
, head matriarch of the Black Rose, manipulated Swain as a young nobleman into revealing the Black Rose and executing its most prominent members, including Swain's own parents and Leblanc herself. However, LeBlanc's execution was a deception, and she retreated back into the shadows of Noxus to wait for an opportunity to strike. For exposing the corruption, Swain was granted a commission in the Noxian army, where he would serve for years to come.

Discovery of Raum
[

Swain learned firsthand that the empire's true strength was upheld not by pure Noxian ferocity, but by all its people united in spite of their origins. Nobles and foreign slaves alike were all seen as soldiers on the front lines.
Swain had carved out his career in securing the western borders, as well as expanding into
Shurima
. But in time, the aging emperor grew more paranoid and unhinged over his own mortality. Fighting wars on too many fronts, lusting over magical relics; greed became the clear motivation of the regime.
During the invasion of
Ionia
, Darkwill retasked much of the warbands to hunt for artifacts that could extend mortal lifespan, With Swain's forces depleted, it became nearly impossible to engage the enemy. At the Battle of the
Placidium
, his troops were overrun in what should have been an ambush. Swain was gravely wounded with his knee shattered and his
arm cut off
. On the verge of death, he felt a familiar darkness press upon him again as a
raven
approached to feed; but he would not let it take him. Staring into the bird's eyes, he saw a vision of the dark truth: that LeBlanc had seduced Darkwill with promises of extending his life, and had sent Swain to die. It was not the raven that told him this, but something deeper. This was the great power that Swain's parents had been looking for, and now he knew it could be found.
Returning to Noxus, Swain was disgraced and regarded as nothing more than a cripple. Through his fragile state, Swain set about in search of that strange power, that which cackled in the darkness like a raven's caw. What he found was Raum, an ancient entity that preyed on the dying and consumed their secrets. But the man solved a puzzle even the demon did not anticipate: a way to wield its power.

Establishment of the Trifarix
[

Swain had physically restored himself and could use magic to defeat his enemies, along with using Raum to listen to the secrets of the dying. Over the course of many years, Swain amassed power, allies, and elaborate plans to kill Darkwill. In the end, it only took one night to capture the throne. Swain revealed himself to all of Noxus, leaving Darkwill dead and the throne empty. In its place, he established the Trifarix: a council of 3 members to take over the responsibilities of the emperor. Together they embody Noxus' core values, with Swain representing Vision,
Darius
exemplifying Might, and The Faceless one embodying Guile. This Council was made so that no one man could rule Noxus, and if one were to divert from the foundations of strength that Noxus was built on, the other two would be able to keep them in check. Moreover, this insurance would counterbalance Swain should he ever befall to demonic corruption.
Swain immediately pulled back the Noxian forces from Darkwill's untenable ventures. He also held conventions detailing his plans for the empire, pardoning the noble houses that swore fealty, and allowing dissenting houses to safely leave the empire. A large part of the dissent was over the new policies that grated traditional power systems such as inherited lordship, personal wealth, and ownership of human property.

Seeing areas of concern abroad and within, Swain sent one of the empire's best assassins in an almost impossible task.
[

Katarina
was assigned to kill the
Demacian
king
Jarvan III
, as well as her own father
Marcus Du Couteau
, who has suspected ties with the Black Rose. However, Marcus intercepted the written order and managed to deter her long enough to get close to destroying Swain. The Grand General intervened in the final duel and backfired the implosive weapon to destroy Marcus instead. He then congratulates Katarina on her success and revealed that the assignment was a test to find an assassin that could eliminate Swain in the event that he becomes corrupt.

The Black Powder Plot
[

]

Secessionists held the mineral-rich
Rokrund Plains
, crafting explosives that deterred Noxian forces from advancing. This prompted Swain to visit the campaign generals and discuss strategy. One of these was General
Brannin Granth
, a secret operative of the Black Rose that plotted to kill Swain. Within the meeting, he proclaimed that the battle was unwinnable without death and revealed an explosive fuse ready to blow. Swain chuckled at the profound suggestion, agreeing that while the soldiers may die anyway, their sacrifice makes way for a greater reinforcement. He then reveals his demon arm and quickly strangles Granth. "Granth and I... we always look for what must be sacrificed in order to win."

The Delverhold Affair
[

edit source
]

Seven years into the Trifarix rule, delegates Oram and Alyssa from
the Delverhold
approached the council to negotiate concessions in response to a local crisis. The mineral export quotas became unsustainable with the dwindling reserves in the Ironspike mines, sinking the people into poverty. Furthermore, Oram argued that their treaty to the empire had been invalidated with the death of the emperor, which permits the Delverhold to extricate from the empire if necessary. While Swain agreed to hear the terms, Darius argued that there was no compelling bargain.
Some days go by, and the delegates attempted to seize and extort the Faceless One for their vote. But in a deceptive trap, Oram is killed by Alyssa and she is quickly captured by the guards. She is brought before the Trifarix, whom were fully aware of the extortion, but recognize her disaffection in the Delverhold. Swain candidly stated that the Trifarix did not want to encourage other provinces to make demands as well. Alyssa said that she knew the Delverhold governor would use the delegates' deaths to justify secession, but returning Delverhold to the kingdom rule would be a grave mistake long-term. She then suggested to become governor herself in order to maintain relations with Noxus. The council agree to the idea and sent a Trifarian entourage with her back to Delverhold to claim office.

Appearance

Swain is a fair skinned man with long, white hair. He wears black armor, black pants, and a black coat. His left arm was restored with the power of Raum, and consequently glows a shade of red.

Personality
[

edit source
]

Swain is cold and calculating, often seeing people's lives as pieces in a bigger game. He is a master tactician and general, able to predict his enemies' next move with his cunning intellect and win battles swiftly and efficiently. Swain does not often act in his own interests, rather doing whatever is best for Noxus, as he knows that the empire is much more important than him, and he is committed to returning it back to its foundations and making sure that it outlasts him.

Abilities

Demonic Bonding
:
After being defeated in battle, Swain made a pact with
Raum
, the
Demon
of Secrets. This granted him several new powers that very few can match.
Emotional Feeding:
Like other Demons, Raum can feed himself from a specific emotion, in this case, secrets. By absorbing the secrets of others, Raum, and by extension Swain, can sustain themselves for prolonged periods of time. Swain also gains knowledge from these secrets and can use this knowledge for his own benefit.
Life Draining:
The Secrets that Swain collects come in the form of Soul Fragments. Taking a soul Fragment from someone drains them of their energy and gives it to Swain. By doing so Swain can heal himself and strengthen his powers.
Extended Awareness:
Swain has heightened senses, meaning that he can perceive and sense things that few else can. He can see things from far away and perceive supernatural powers that no others can notice.
Demon Ravens
:
Swain can summon several demonic Ravens that are connected to his mind. He can use them as a way to gather intelligence and spy on people.
Demonic Energy:
Swain can manipulate powerful dark energies to his liking. Those dark energies come from Raum, and depend on how strong Raum himself is.
Energy blasts:
Swain can summon powerful eldritch blasts.
Limbs Creation:
Swain can create limbs for himself such as hands and wings.
