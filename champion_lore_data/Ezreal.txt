Early Life
[

|
edit source
]

Ezreal was born and raised in a wealthy neighborhood of
Piltover
as the son of two renowned archeologists. As explorers, Ezreal's parents were often away for extended periods of time on expeditions while Ezreal was taken care of by his uncle, Professor Lymere. Becoming used to his parents' absence, Ezreal loved hearing the stories his parents would tell him of their adventures, often fantasizing about joining them on their travels. Ezreal's father would typically tell him the stories of their travels, eventually sharing his plans for an incredibly secretive and ambitious expedition. Ezreal's father sought out the
Tomb of Ne'Zuk
, a
Shuriman
tyrant rumored to have the ability to jump from one place to another. He would often joke to the young Ezreal that, if he learned Ne'Zuk's teleportation magic, he would use it to continue his travels and jump back into Piltover in time for dinner.
Professor Lymere had trouble raising Ezreal, who was an unruly and rash child, often being tutored on various subjects just to keep him busy and out of trouble. These subjects included advanced cartography,
Hextech
mechanics and ancient histories of
Runeterra
, which Ezreal found extremely easy to grasp thanks to his prodigal skill in learning. Seeing studying as a waste of time, he often passed all assessments easily with little or no preparation, infuriating his uncle as he had more free time to roam the university grounds. Being a troublemaker, Ezreal often spent time evading campus wardens, navigating tunnels underneath lecture halls and even practicing lockpicking to sneak into his teachers' offices and rearrange their belongings.

Disappearance of Parents
[

|
edit source
]

As Ezreal grew older, the absences of his parents became longer to the point where they simply didn't return home one day. At that point, Ezreal's uncle tearfully admitted that the two had most likely died somewhere in the Shuriman desert, which Ezreal simply couldn't accept. Having heard of all the preparations and studies his parents would make for these expeditions, Ezreal was still convinced that his parents were still out there somewhere. Ezreal decided he'd find his parents on his own as he planned to search the location of their most important expedition; the Tomb of Ne'Zuk. In preparation, Ezreal abandoned his studies and gathered supplies from the university such as celestial diagrams, runic sigil translations, guides on the burial rites of Shurima and even a pair of protective goggles. Leaving a farewell note for his uncle, Ezreal snuck onto a supply ship heading towards the Shuriman city of
Nashramae
. The ship's captain discovered Ezreal as a stowaway and threatened to throw Ezreal overboard before he convinced them otherwise by agreeing to act as their navigator, as the previous navigator was unfortunately lost at sea.

Finding the Tomb of Ne'Zuk
[
edit
|
edit source
]

In Shurima, Ezreal followed his mother's meticulous field notes and crossed the
The Great Sai
with merchant caravans. For months, Ezreal explored the most ancient Shuriman locations as he delved into cavernous ruins beneath the sands and faced unspeakable horrors that guarded hidden chambers, imagining himself as following his parents' path as an adventurer.

lost tomb
.
Finally, Ezreal found the tomb of Ne'Zuk underneath a mausoleum for some unnamed emperor, achieving what his parents unfortunately couldn't. The sarcophagus in the tomb however was empty, save for a gleaming bronze gauntlet with a crystalline matrix at its center. As soon as Ezreal touched it, the tomb began to turn on him, activating various thousand year old traps and wards. Improvising and thinking on instinct, Ezreal used the gauntlet and shot out a
powerful blast of arcane energy
to create a hole for him to exit through. He then
teleported instantly
to the hidden entrance right before the entire tomb collapsed into sand.
Having barely escaped, Ezreal looked down at the mysterious gauntlet as it hummed in-sync with his heartbeat, feeling it siphoning and amplifying his own magical essence. After some investigation, Ezreal discovered that the gauntlet was a fearsome weapon belonging to an
Ascended God-Warrior
, which he saw as perfect for an explorer like himself.

Modern History
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Having found the mystical gauntlet in Ne'Zuk's now collapsed tomb, Ezreal soon returned to Piltover and continued to go on various adventures and expeditions. Ezreal travelled to lost cities, mystical temples and other ancient locations that university professors would only read about on maps, slowly growing his reputation as a treasure-seeking explorer as many would begin telling stories of his exploits, which Ezreal usually saw as incapable of conveying the true scope and scale of his feats. Ezreal chased fame and glory throughout all parts of the world to create a name for himself, but he still hoped that his parents would one day catch word of his grand explorations and eventually seek him out in person.
In order to become an officially renowned explorer, Ezreal desperately sought to join the esteemed Piltover Explorers Guild, a widespread organization consisting of Runeterra's best explorers and adventurers. However, Ezreal would be denied entry into the Explorers Guild for currently unknown reasons, angering Ezreal since he believed he was more than qualified to join because of all the dangerous adventures he'd already gone on, and even seeking full acreditation on the guild in exchange for artifact retrieval jobs, like the time he was hired by Januk, a freljordian explorer member of the guild in such way.

The Vault of Resplendent Hollies
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Following Professor Lymere's theories about Zaun's ancient history as a Shuriman port city once called
Oshra Va'Zaun,
Ezreal realized that his uncle had no proof for his theories and decided to search the deepest parts of Zaun to find proof and take credit.
[

]
Eventually, Ezreal would discover stories about the
Vault of Resplendent Hollies
, an ancient and renowned Shuriman vault believed to be full of artifacts and lost temples.
[

]
Ezreal eventually learned from a few sources that industrial excavations in Zaun have opened up a crack in the deepest and flooded depths of the
Sump
layer of Zaun, which he delved into in search of the vault.

Zaun's
Sump
As Ezreal began to lose morale over finding nothing within the depths, he managed to find an ancient door most likely to the Vault of Resplendent Holies. The door was lined with various Shuriman glyphs, including a few that resembled owls, which Ezreal deciphered as a warning about a curse that 'multiplies' into a thousand curses, though his Shuriman was candid and rusty. Unable to unlock the door, Ezreal shot a
blast of arcane magic
through it, creating a hole for him to enter.
Ezreal hiding from fiery
Golems
within the vault.
Once inside the vault, Ezreal found various relics such as one that belonged to Carikkan, the Shuriman emperor's personal spirit-banisher who bound troublesome entities to inanimate objects for his own dark purposes. While rummaging through Carikkan's many relics, Ezreal encountered an army of fiery stone-warrior
Golems
that defended Carikkan's artifats, which he easily obliterated with shots of arcane energy. Another artifact that Ezreal found was a perfectly preserved golden stele inscribed with the legend of the
"Day of Fire"
and Carikkan's oath to protect Oshra Va'Zaun.
After defeating more fiery Golems, a rush of water started to flood in through the cracks of the floor, forcing Ezreal to swim through tunnels to reach the surface again while carrying the golden stele. Managing to escape, Ezreal traveled back to Piltover and visited
Zaile's
, an outfitter store where Ezreal intended to get his jacket, now torn to shreds, tailored and repaired. Ezreal intended to look as good as possible so that he can impress the Explorers Guild by presenting his journal recording his explorations within the Vault of Resplendent Holies.

While getting his jacket tailored at Zaile's, Ezreal left the golden stele by a window, causing it to come in contact with direct sunlight during an equinox. The stele began to glow and speak in an ancient language before exploding into a swarm of infernal locust creatures. As more locusts began to pour out of the sewer grates, Ezreal helped clear them out by using blasts from his gauntlet. A few days later, Ezreal faced legal repercussions for bringing the dangerous artifact into Piltover and causing property damage to the mercantile district. Though he sought legal advice and read up on Piltover's libel and slander laws, he ultimately decided to represent
himself
in court. In order to prove his innocence however, Ezreal quickly logged a possibly false log on his journal to act as evidence, which directly stated that he had nothing to do with the outbreak and blamed the clerk at Zaile's for placing the stele in the sunlight.

Various Adventures
[

edit source
]

Ezreal continued his adventurous expeditions across the world, writing them in his field notes to record his endeavors and impress the Explorers Guild so they can grant him membership:

Adventures in Shurima
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ezreal first traveled southwest of Piltover to the city of Bel'zhun, located in northern Shurima and occupied by Noxian rule. Ezreal knew that the best guides in Shurima were found in the coastal city and found Kasdjar, a knowledgeable and charismatic guide who shared many details about the ancient histories of Shurima as they travelled.
The two traveled through the desert together, at some point going to the ancient city of
Nerimazeth
. While scouring the ruins for priceless artifacts, Kasdjar shared many historical facts about the lands outside of the city, noting that they were once home to the first prototype Sun Disc before it failed and collapsed. Towards the south of
Sai Kahleek
, Ezreal encountered many
Xer'Sai
creatures, defending him and his guide by using the magic of his gauntlet. The two took shelter in a circular cavern, which Kasdjar quickly realized was a gargantuan Xer'Sai burrow and the lair of the
Sand Mother
as the two quickly left as soon as they could. At some point, Kasdjar was tragically killed when a massive obelisk fell on him. Despite this, Ezreal continued his adventure down south reached the edge of
Icathia
, which he immediately saw as way too dangerous and turned around instantly.

Deserted Island East of Shurima
[
edit
|
edit source
]

At some point, Ezreal sailed out of the
Shuriman jungles
and shipwrecked on a deserted island home to mysterious, albeit aggressively flirtatious walrus-esque beings. After about a week, Ezreal repaired his ship and sailed back to the main land.

Mystery Contact in the Immortal Bastion
[
edit
|
edit source
]

In the Noxian capital city, Ezreal once planned to meet a new, mysterious contact to collect archival materials. While waiting for her, Ezreal strolled the promenades surrounding the
Immortal Bastion
, sampling Noxian cuisine, notably their tacos, and inspecting he monoliths of dark magic that made up the fortress. Ezreal's contact never showed, but he noticed many spies following him until one of them handed him a
rose petal colored black
. Now sensing danger, Ezreal decided to leave the city and found black petals every day until he left the border, even finding one in his satchel.

The Kindred's Masks
[
edit
|
edit source
]

In the Demacian city of
Jandelle
, Ezreal searched for a pair of masks supposedly belonging to the
Kindred
themselves, having been carved out of a bewitched eldlock tree. While searching though, Ezreal began to reminisce on an
old tale
about a famous Demacian actress who died on stage while playing the dual role of Kindred. Though the masks she wore for that role mysteriously disappeared, Ezreal theorized that these were the original masks of the Kindred and believed they were most likely locked away in a collector's show room.

Jarro Lightfeather
[
edit
|
edit source
]

While staying in Demacia, Ezreal took on the alias of
Jarro Lightfeather
, a fake identity of a
Sentinel of Light
who was born in
Vaskasia
. While taking on the name of Jarro Lightfeather, Ezreal met various Demacians and became a renowned and seemingly infamous national hero.

Avarosan Mountain Totem
[
edit
|
edit source
]

At the eastern parts of
Rakelstake
in the Freljord, Ezreal encountered the
Avarosans
and procured a silver totem at the top of a freezing mountain. After that, Ezreal faced trouble with the tribe and fled as quickly as possible, denying any claims that he was ever in the Freljord to the Avarosans.

Mutiny at Targonian Seas
[
edit
|
edit source
]

While sailing around the oceans east of
Mount Targon
, Ezreal took in the beauty of the Targonian night sky. At the same time however, Ezreal helped quell a mutiny that occurred on the ship he had stowed away on.

Studying the Buhru
[
edit
|
edit source
]

In
Bilgewater
, Ezreal studied the local
Buhru
culture on the
Blue Flame Isles
, which he knew as the
Serpent Isles
, and came to learn that their religion predates everything found on both
Valoran
and Shurima. Having joined in on the festive ceremonies of the Buhru, Ezreal caught sight of
Illaoi
, curiously examining the massive idol she carried on her.

Bandle Portal Encounter
[
edit
|
edit source
]

At the southern parts of the
Renek River
, Ezreal faced off against the eight tribes of the Southern Dune Wanderers, who chased him through the mountains for stealing their sacred medallion. While running though, Ezreal found a rock with a shimmering gap in it, opening up a portal to
Bandle City
before vanishing. Though Ezreal camped out for a week to see it again, it never reappeared and Ezreal convinced himself it may have been a hallucination.

Game of Krakenhand
[
edit
|
edit source
]

In
Mudtown
, Ezreal got captured by a gang of marauders who took his gauntlet and possibly other belongings. However, after playing a game of Krakenhand with the gang, Ezreal quickly befriended the gang members and proved his worth to them. Despite not knowing how to play whatsoever, Ezreal managed to win his gauntlet back along with an antique flintlock.

The Elixir of Uloa
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ezreal, wanting to once again apply for membership in the Explorers Guild, reunited with Januk, a Freljordian explorer known for illegally raiding museums, and with whom the explorer had already worked before, albeit in uneasy terms as they constantly betrayed one another on their adventures. One instance of such betrayals was when Januk, as payback for the time Ezreal ran off with an important map, purposefully blew Ezreal's cover after they salvaged the wreck of a ship called the Echelon Dawn, which in turn prompted Ezreal to leave him behind on a noxian prision camp. Despite this, Ezreal agreed to do a job for him; find the mythical Elixir of Uloa, a potion sought out by many cults and believed to imbue people with immortality upon consumption. In return, Januk agreed to pay Ezreal sixty thousand, along with full accreditation in the guild.
[

]
Searching for the elixir in the Shuriman jungles, Ezreal arrived in the village of
Paretha
. While staying at the village, Ezreal traveled to the
Vale of Silver Mist
, a magical part of the jungles outside of Paretha. After drinking some taffa-flower water he found in the jungle, Ezreal found what appeared to be an
exact copy of himself
curiously peering at him from behind a tree, which he choked up to hallucinations from drinking the flower water.
[

]

Ezreal discovering a mysterious temple in
Paretha
, which housed the Elixir of Uloa.
After a few hours in the jungles, Ezreal found an underground crypt and entered it, easily traversing the many labyrinthine tunnels and traps until he reached a room with the Elixir of Uloa sitting on top of a pedestal. Anticipating more traps to activate if he approaches the vial, Ezreal carefully stepped towards it and lightly grasped the elixir, causing hundreds of sharp stakes to drop, which he narrowly escaped by teleporting away at the last second. Noticing the tomb's supports begin to fall apart, Ezreal quickly traversed back the way he came, escaping the chamber as the floors began to crack and split. Giant insects with large pincers and red eyes began to crawl through the collapsed walls, attacking Ezreal as he defended himself with a few blasts from his gauntlet. As Ezreal slid towards the exit, the chamber suddenly fell apart right in front of him and closed off his only exit out of the crypt. Just in type though, Ezreal blasted a hole through the collapsed chamber with his magical gauntlet and left with the Elixir of Uloa in hand while the tomb's entrance began to cave in completely.
[

]
With the elixir in his possession, Ezreal stayed in Paretha to gather supplies. A tribal shaman of the village claimed that Ezreal's soul was entwined with the
Aspect of the Wanderer,
which confused Ezreal as he didn't think the shaman looked Targonian. Not wishing to face the citizens of Paretha when they realize he caused the collapse of their ancient temple, Ezreal quickly left and began travelling back to Januk to deliver the elixir.
[
2
]
Meeting with Jaunk, Ezreal described the feats he pulled when trying to achieve the elixir but refused to give it without the proper payment. Though Januk offered him his payment in money, Ezreal added that he wanted full accreditation within the Explorers Guild as well, which Januk didn't wanna comply with since the Guild weren't very fond of Ezreal and neither was Januk. When Ezreal threatened to give the elixir to a different buyer, Januk laughed it off and went to his office to grab a letter that can grant Ezreal full accreditation in the guild, which Ezreal easily realized was a potential betrayal about to happen. While examining a peculiar bell in Januk's collection, Ezreal heard him state that the bell had
Ochnun
written on it; the language of the dead. Turning around to face Januk, Ezreal saw him pointing two flintlock pistols at his head.

Ezreal and an angry Januk pointing his flintlock pistols.
Januk stated that Ezreal's application to the guild has been denied and revealed that he's part of a cult that sought to use the elixir to raise a
fallen dreadlord
from the dead. Dodging the gunshots with his teleportation magic, Januk grabbed Ezreal by the gauntlet and tossed him to the floor before kicking his ribs and snagging the elixir out of his grip. After proudly drinking it, Ezreal revealed that the elixir he just drank was actually a bottle of sand wasp venom; a very potent laxative. As he pulled out the true elixir, Januk groaned and collapsed on the floor while Ezreal quickly grabbed the Ochnun bell and leapt out of Januk's office window, hoping to bring the bell back to the Explorers Guild as a way to earn membership.

Kai'Sa
and Ezreal fighting off a swarm of
Voidlings
together.
On a recent expedition to Shurima, Ezreal managed to locate an ancient temple holding the legendary artifact known as the
Tear of the Goddess
. After removing the magical gem from its base, the temple triggered a mechanism that released a swarm of
Voidling
creatures from the ground and slowly sealed the temple entrance. Just as the door closed and the swarm closed in,
Kai'Sa
flew down and blasted a bunch of Voidlings and a hole through the closed entrance. Kai'Sa continued fighting off the swarm while Ezreal had a chance to run off with the gemstone. However, Ezreal hesitated and noticed Kai'Sa getting overwhelmed by the amount of Voidlings, dropping the gem and firing an arcane blast at the creatures before teleporting at Kai'Sa's side. The two fought alongside each other and cleared out most of the swarm as they quickly rushed towards the exit, managing to escape and eventually part ways.

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ezreal is a young slim pale skinned man with tousled blonde hair and blue eyes.
He wears a small brown leather jacket, sometimes undersized so it barely reaches his waist, and some others a more regular sized one. In some versions of the jacket, the collar has a deep-blue furry lining, while in others the jacket has a hood in which the lining is shorter and more wooly-looking, but of a similar color.  Both of his sleeves are rolled up, exposing his forearms. Underneath the jacket. he wears a white shirt with a low V-neck which is adorned with brown colored diamond motives. Since its sleeves can't be seen on his arms, it is either a short-sleeved t-shirt or a tank top. On his left hand he wears an oversized bronze colored (depicted usually more yellowish) glove shaped Shuriman artifact known as the Gauntlet of Ne'Zuk. On his right hand he wears a fingerless glove, probably made from some kind of leather too.
He also wears dark high boots and skinny jeans with a pair of belts: one for the jeans themselves and another with several pockets. He wears a secondary thigh belt with an extra pocket in his right leg and has both knees protected by brown colored pads sewed into the jeans.
His most distinctive physical feature is the pair of triangular-shaped light blue colored marks appearing right on his cheekbones, products of magic expression in his body that glow brighter when he channels magical energy.
[

He also wears a pair of protective glasses, either tightened into his head or  hanging from his neck.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ezreal is an intelligent and cunning young man that appears to be an arrogant and narcissistic person. He also seems to be a very self-confident individual, always getting into trouble and not being very careful of traps and monsters he encounters as he explores, not caring about the 'collateral damage' he might incur in when exploring.
[
7
]
As stated in his biography, at least part of his attention-seeking behavior comes from a young age. Back when he was kid attending university at petition of his uncle, he was already known for his troublemaking behavior, lockpicking into restricted areas, evading the university wardens, rearranging the professors desks, and even for more infamous and notoriously complex pranks.
[
8
]
Even in his shenanigans as explorer, not taking into account any rules or legal proceedings to do things, all in hopes of his parents being out there and coming back to him if he makes enough of a reputation as an explorer.
Despite showing this ego-inflated attitude, Ezreal is a wounded inside individual that uses this confident exterior to cover trauma he wouldn't admit having.
[
7
]
[
9
]
He is a very critical individual
of the people and city he grew up in
, because he sees his own flaws exaggerated in them.
[

]
He has a rather evident image problem, dissonant with his exterior self-centered attitude, Ezreal appears to not stand looking to his reflection in a mirror.

Abilities
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Mage
Ezreal was naturally born with inherent magical abilities that could grow with proper training and control. Ezreal's abilities however are largely underdeveloped due to having relied on his
gauntlet
as a 'shortcut' to accessing his magical abilities. He could use magic without the gauntlet to some extent, but it would quickly become a burden.
[
6
]
Arcane Energy Blasts:
Ezreal's innate magical abilities allow him to fire off arcane energy as small blasts. When Ezreal channels his innate arcane energy, the light-blue markings on his face glow brighter as a signal of his inherent magic.
Left Gauntlet of Ne'Zuk:
Ezreal wields the Left Gauntlet of Ne'Zuk, an ancient weapon designed for an
Ascended
that is capable of granting Ezreal the ability to teleport short distances instantaneously. Though it's unclear how much control and how far he can teleport, Ezreal has jumped as far as a hundred yards. Along with that, the gauntlet activates and empowers Ezreal's own latent magical abilities, allowing him to fire even
larger blasts
of arcane energy.
High Intelligence:
Since childhood, Ezreal showed great talent in learning all knowledge presented to him, as he easily absorbs information like a sponge. Being raised by his uncle Professor Lymere, Ezreal has been thoroughly educated in many subjects such as ancient
Runeterran
history, advanced cartography and even
hextech
mechanics.
Exploration Mastery:
Ezreal is nearly an expert in adventuring and exploration, having experienced many life-threatening events while traversing dangerous locations in pursuit of fame and glory. Ezreal utilizes his intense knowledge in tandem with his skills in adventuring, capable of surveying traps within dangerous tombs, being capable of deciphering several ancient languages and even being able to understand the rich histories of the ancient places he explores.

Relations
[

Unnamed Parents
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ezreal's parents were renown archaeologists of Piltover who, due to their expeditions and adventures outside of Piltover, would often leave Ezreal under the care of his uncle Professor Lymere. Despite their absences, they had a very clear love for their son and kept a good relationship with him on the short occasions that they'd return home to see him.
Ezreal's father would often tell him of their many adventures in the form of stories that amazed the young boy, sparking his initial interest in adventuring and following in his parents' footsteps. Ezreal initially heard the story of Ne'Zuk from his father, who often described it as being his most ambitiously planned expedition as he joked to learn Ne'Zuk's teleportation magic so that he can instantly teleport back home after an adventure.
Ezreal's mother was a talented navigator and the one who wrote meticulous field notes that Ezreal eventually used to help him navigate Shurima when he initially searched for the Tomb of Ne'Zuk.
After their sudden disappearence, their fates remain unknown despite Ezreal's uncle believing that they most likely died on their adventure. However, Ezreal simply refuses to believe that and constantly copes with the idea that they'll eventually return. To this day, Ezreal continues to create a name for himself as a famous explorer with the intent of making sure his parents catch word of their son's grand feats, hopefully convincing them to return home finally.

Professor Lymere
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Professor Lymere is Ezreal's uncle and the one who primarily took care of him while growing up due to the absence of his parents. Due to Ezreal's troublesome nature as a child, the two had a rocky and tumultuous relationship. In order to occupy the boy and keep him from causing trouble, Professor Lymere enrolled him into college level courses, which proved ineffective due to Ezreal's incredible ability to absorb and retain knowledge. Freeing up his time from his uncle's classes, Ezreal would continue to cause mischief on the university campus, often angering Professor Lymere.
To this day the two stay in touch and, despite their turbulent relationship, Ezreal seems to share some respect for his uncle as a professor. When Ezreal discovered Lymere's theories on Zaun's ancient history as a
Shuriman
port city called
Oshra Va'Zaun,
he felt a bit of pity due to his lack of evidence and traversed the Vault of Resplendent Hollies to search for some to bring back, yet intended to take all the credit for himself.

Ne'Zuk
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ne'Zuk is an ancient
Ixtali
Ascended
tyrant who was long dead after Ezreal raided his tomb in search of his parents. Though his tomb held the gauntlet that Ezreal eventually took, it is actually a part of a pair of gauntlets that were originally wielded by another Ascended named Horok, who Ne'Zuk seemingly murdered and took the gauntlet from in ancient times.

Avarosans
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ezreal encountered the Avarosan tribe when he travelled to the
Freljord
and stole a silver totem at the top of a freezing mountain. It's unclear what exactly transpired, but Ezreal insists on having never met the Avarosans, most likely in fear of being caught for something he did while grabbing the silver totem.

Black Rose
[
edit
|
edit source
]

The Black Rose seem aware of Ezreal's name as a growing, renown adventurer. Though Ezreal doesn't seem completely aware of who the Black Rose are, he seems knowledgable about the dark magics hiding underneath the
Noxian
capital and encountered several Black Rose spies when he tried meeting with a mysterious contact for archival material at Noxus.

Neeko
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Though Ezreal doesn't officially know who Neeko really is, he seemingly encountered her on his expedition to
Paretha
in search of the Elixir of Uloa. While in the jungles of Paretha, Ezreal encountered Neeko as she disguised herself as him, which Ezreal convinced himself was a hallucination from ingesting the taffa flower water.

Illaoi
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ezreal never formally met or was introduced to Illaoi, but he caught a clear glimpse of her while in
Bilgewater
, studying the Buhru culture and the origin of their religion. While enjoying the Buhru festivities, Ezreal saw Illaoi but focused more on her idol she carried around rather than the priestess herself.

Piltover Explorers Guild
[
edit
|
edit source
]

As part of his mission to create a name for himself, Ezreal constantly wishes to join the Piltover Explorers Guild as an official member. However, the guild denied Ezreal's application and actively avoids accrediting him as a member. When speaking with another member of the guild named Januk, Ezreal learns that the guild isn't fond of Ezreal due to his unorthodox methods in exploration and possibly due to his prideful personality as well.
Because of this, Ezreal holds a lot of spite and disdain for the guild and its members for not allowing him to join. However, he still considers the denial of the guild to be one of the more painful things he's been denied entry in.

Januk
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Januk is a Freljordian member of the Piltover Explorers Guild who is most known for his illegal raiding of museums and dining on his collection of treasures. Despite working together on a couple adventures, the two consider each other rivals and even enemies due to a streak of betrayals on one another. Though Ezreal himself can't recall who started it, the earliest known instance is when Ezreal seemingly ran off with an important map that Januk needed. As payback, Januk blew Ezreal's cover when the two salvaged the wreck of a ship called the
Echelon Dawn.
Most recently, Januk agreed to pay and accredit Ezreal to the guild if he obtained the mystical Elixir of Uloa for him, which Ezreal did easily. However when he tried to deliver it, Januk betrayed him and revealed himself as a cultist in service to a
fallen dreadlord
. Ezreal managed to beat Januk by having him drink a laxative poison disguised as the potion before stealing his
Ochnun bell
and running out of his office window.

Kasdjar
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ezreal met Kasdjar when he traveled to the
Shuriman
city of
Bel'zhun
, which had been occupied by
Noxian
rule. Ezreal hired Kasdjar to be his guide due to his notable charisma and knowledge on the ancient histories of Shurima. The two travelled together through the desert, ranging from the ancient city of
Nerimazeth
to the deserts of the
Sai Kahleek
.
Unfortunately, at some unspecified point, Kasdjar perished when a giant obelisk fell and crushed him instantly. Ezreal, though he hardly knew Kasdjar, feels bad about his untimely death nonetheless.

Xer'Sai
[

|

]

While travelling Shurima with his guide Kasdjar, Ezreal encountered and defeated many Xer'Sai creatures while traversing the southern sands of
Sai Kahleek
.

Rek'Sai
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Ezreal hasn't encountered Rek'Sai herself but battled several of her Xer'Sai spawn while traversing the Sai Kahleek. Taking shelter inside a massive circular cavern, Ezreal's guide recognized the cave as massive Xer'Sai burrow and most likely the lair of Rek'Sai herself, who they referred to as
the Sand Mother.
Learning this, the two quickly left Rek'Sai's nest before she could return.

Kassadin
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Though the two have never met each other, Kassadin and Ezreal are intricately linked due to their pasts. Unaware to Ezreal, his gauntlet is a single part of a pair originally wielded by the
Ascended
hero Horok before Ne'Zuk murdered him and took the gauntlet for himself. Kassadin is aware of this knowledge and actually wields the second gauntlet that Horok managed to keep known as the
Nether Blade
.

Though not directly stated, it is heavily implied that Ezreal's parents actually knew Kassadin and hired him as a guide in search for Ne'Zuk's Tomb. However, the group actually found Horok's tomb instead holding the Nether Blade, which Ezreal's parents considered valuable all the same.

On an expedition to obtain the
Tear of the Goddess
in a Shuriman tomb, Ezreal encountered Kai'Sa, who saved him from a swarm of
Voidlings
attacking him. Though she blew an exit in the tomb for Ezreal to escape out of, he refused to leave her and teleported in the fight returning the favor, the two fought the swarm of Voidlings as they quickly escaped the tomb together.
Though their exact relationship is unknown, he is one of the few people that Kai'Sa considers a close friend alongside
Taliyah
.
