Relic Pistol Proficiency:
As a novice
Sentinel
, Lucian was trained in wielding the relic pistol of his deceased father Urias. After the loss of his wife
Senna
, Lucian wielded her pistol as well, learning to wield both masterfully. With these pistols, Lucian is capable of firing
concentrated rays of light
either as single blasts or even in the form of a
barrage of shots.
These pistols are uniquely designed to harm the undead
wraiths
of the
Shadow Isles
thanks to their relic stone material.
Enhanced Agility:
Lucian is capable of dashing moderate distances at incredible speeds, almost to the speed of light. This skill allows Lucian to dodge danger or pursue fleeing enemies. It is unknown what the nature of this ability is but it could potentially be magical or a result of his relic pistols.
Undead Hunting Mastery:
As a veteran Sentinel, Lucian is extremely well versed in hunting the undead, particularly the wraiths of the Shadow Isles. Having trained alongside his wife for years, Lucian has become knowledgeable on the weaknesses of these wraiths as well as the best tactics in combatting them.
