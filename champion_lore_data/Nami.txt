The Tidecaller

Nami
was born and raised in the territory of the
Marai
, a tribe of
Vastaya
that live underwater in the sea on the coastline of
Mount Targon
. Nami grew up to be a stubborn but fierce fighter, but it often got her in trouble. She aspired to become the tribe's Tidecaller, a title given to a strong warrior who would go into the depths of the sea to find a pearl. The Marai would give this pearl to a group of humans in exchange for a moonstone, a glowing rock that would ward off dangerous creatures from the deep sea. A Tidecaller is titled and sent on their quest whenever the moonstone's light starts to dim. The deep sea is wrought with dangerous creatures, so the warrior titled a Tidecaller must be strong enough to survive them and find the pearl.

The Moonstone Dims

During Nami's adolescence, the moonstone in the center of the Marai's village began to dim.
Nami
attempted the trial of the Tidecaller, but she was denied due to her impulsiveness. Instead, another warrior named Rasho was sent down into the deep sea to retrieve the pearl. But after a month, Rasho had not returned. Determined to prove herself and save her people, Nami took her mother's staff and plunged into the depths.
After several days, Nami returned with the pearl and Rasho's staff. She was designated Tidecaller by her people and she went to the surface to trade with the humans for the moonstone. However, when she arrived to the surface, a woman told Nami that the
Aspect of the Moon
, the person that made the moonstones, had fled Targon and as such they could not give them the stone. Nami then vowed to find the Aspect and retrieve the moonstone. Then, Nami used the Tidecaller staff to summon a perpetual pool of moving water underneath her fins and set out on her quest.
