Early Life

Most of what is known about Janna is known through secondhand accounts and stories. Since ancient times, there were those who prayed to the winds. Some said that the winds would even answer sometimes. Seafarers said that they would spot a
bright blue bird
just before heavy winds, and others would say that they'd heard a whistling in the air right before a storm, as if to warn them of its approach. These stories spread and gained reverence among people all across
Runeterra
, with some saying that they had seen a bright blue bird transform into a woman with tapered ears and flowing hair. This mysterious figure was said to float above the water and direct the wind with a flick of her staff.
Those that believed in these tales called this wind spirit "Jan'ahrem", an ancient
Shuriman
word meaning “guardian,” as she always seemed to appear in times of great need. As time went on, she became known more simply as Janna.
These tales spread across the Shuriman continent, with Janna's most faithful believers residing in what is now known as
Zaun
, as they needed calm seas for their city's port. These people made statues and shrines and regularly prayed to Janna, asking for calm seas and favorable winds. Despite decrees suppressing worship of false idols, Janna's devotees remained faithful, wearing amulets with the image of a blue bird in reverence for her.

Belief in Zaun

After the fall of the Shuriman empire, what was now the Shuriman deserts became enveloped in war. Despite this,
Zaun
remained untouched, as Janna shielded it from the turmoil.
Over time, less and less people in Zaun prayed to Janna, instead becoming preoccupied with machines and advancing technology. However, one day, entire districts collapsed below sea level, and thousands had to fight for their lives against the currents of the River Pilt. This reignited faith in Janna, as the victims prayed to her for salvation and survival. Despite being forgotten for all this time, Janna helped the people. She used her wind magic not only to stop the water of the river from destroying homes so that people could evacuate, but also to quell smoke coming from fires so that people could see and breath better as they ran. While many died, those that survived saw what Janna did, and a belief and faithfulness to Janna was reignited within the Zaunite people, with her faithful once again wearing amulets reminiscent of blue birds and praying to her frequently.

Deep Breath

A
Zaunite
orphan prays to Janna. While he prays, he reflects on his life, including how difficult being a Zaunite is and how he is discriminated against because of his origins in the city. After an outburst of sadness, Janna appears behind the boy. She calms and hugs him, saying that it will be okay in the end. After comforting the boy, Janna throws a
windy tornado
on a
piltovan
citizen who had humiliated the boy, and this managed to get a smile from the little orphan.
