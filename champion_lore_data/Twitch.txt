Twitch was born a plague rat in
Zaun
, though not much else is known about his past. Over time, he would become a collector of garbage in the sewers, which he considered to be priceless treasures. In a H.I.V.E. incident report, investigators recorded an encounter with Twitch in an industrial facility, where he attacked several scientists and killed several members of the response team. The team recovered a number of items belonging to Twitch, which consisted entirely of garbage. Since then, the rat has become one of many local bogeymen rumored about in the area.

Twitch is a disheveled anthropomorphic rat with faded, moss-green fur, a hunched posture, and a prehensile tail. His jagged claws and buck teeth are a dirty, washed-out yellow. He has pink eyes as well as pink skin visible on his nose and the inside of his ears.
His attire is ragged and torn, most notably a green overcoat with the sleeves ripped off. It has a faded gold trim, twin tails, and a wide, flared collar. He has numerous straps and pouches carrying flasks of green poison and other miscellanea. He also wears a cracked pair of goggles. There are rusted metal plates armoring his right arm where he carries his crossbow. The makeshift mechanical crossbow is fastened with a chamber that loads his bolts with green chemicals.

Personality

Twitch considers himself a "connoisseur of the finer things", by which he means garbage and filth thrown into the Sump by
Piltover
. He behaves pretentiously around others and doesn't believe in "sharing", combining a collector's spirit with unabashedly disgusting habits. He has an unpredictable, sneaky, and mischievous side, taking pleasure in scaring people and harming
scuttle crabs
with his
vile sewer concoctions
. He doesn't seem to have any regard for human life, being responsible for a number of industrial homicides in the Sump works with no clear motive.
