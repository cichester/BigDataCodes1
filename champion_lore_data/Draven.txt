Background
[

Draven grew up as an orphan on the streets of
Basilich
brawling with older children on the street and shady underworld thugs. He was confident in his own abilities even back then. Some may describe him as
overconfident
. However, it is unlikely that Draven would have survived his childhood if it wasn't for his brother, Darius.
Once Draven and Darius' hometown fell to the warhosts of Noxus, the two came to the attention of a captain named Cyrus, who Draven made an ill-considered attempt to take his life. In spite of this, Cyrus was impressed with their fighting spirits and allowed them to join the ranks of the Noxus army.
For many years, Draven and Darius fought as a part of Cyrus' warhost. Darius found taking on this life was rather easy, but Draven grew increasingly bored. His skills were beyond question, but the everyday life of being a soldier felt like too much effort for too little of a reward. Additionally, there was not enough personal glory.
Darius came to order his own warband and Draven joined him. He thought this might be easier, or another way to achieve greater recognition for himself but ultimately, he was disappointed.
Rumors have been made as to why Draven left Darius' command. One rumor says that Draven chose to leave his brother's command. Another says he was forced out of command. Whichever is correct, it is undeniable that his skills were highly sought after as both a champion and a duelist and eventually, he was convinced and decided to join a succession of warbands during the occupation of Ionia before ending up with a fairly respectable contract in the Reckoning Pits. 
For many years, the gladiatorial Reckoners had performed a vital role in Noxus; punishing criminals and settling disputes between the noble houses. Draven had his mind set on receiving the riches, adoration, and renown he felt deserved. However, with long, protracted wars on many fronts, the spectacle was beignning to lose its appeal for the common citizen. As the attention of the crowds shifted, Draven fell into a slump, spending more time in the seedier drinking halls and gambling dens of the capital. He ended up washed-up and broke when the former general
Jericho Swain
found him.

With a knack for spectacle and showmanship, Draven is a bombastic, blustering personality and a famous crowd-pleaser during his gladiatorial "performances." He is brash and impulsive, often acting purely on instinct. In addition, he is almost cartoonishly arrogant, loving himself and the sound of his own name with extreme passion. As such, he often refers to himself in the third person. He is also an enthusiastic killer, executing his opponents in the ring with brutal thrill.
