The Burning Vengeance

Brand was born as Kegan Rodhe in the
Freljord
, in the region of
Lokfar
in a settlement called Rygann's Reach. His mother was a healer and his father was a reaver. Because of this and the fact that his father never stayed to raise him, he earned the nickname "Reaver-Bastard" among the people of Rygann's Reach.
Kegan and his mother were shunned from the settlement, with the only reason they weren't banished from the settlement entirely being that Kegan's mother healed the denisons of Rygann's Reach. Due to all of this, Kegan was often the subject of ridicule from the townspeople, often being called names and getting in fights. His only friend was Zvanna, a local girl he met shortly after she and her family had moved to Rygann's reach. Kegan and Zvanna were lovers for a time, but stopped at some point for unknown reasons, most likely because of Kegan's temper against the townspeople that were cruel to him.

Banishment

From the Ashes

After the death of his mother, Kegan was informed by Zvanna that the Townspeople of Rygann's Reach wanted him to leave. After packing up and getting ready to leave, Kegan snuck into the home of Rygann, the leader of Rygann's Reach and the person that Kegan hated and blamed the most for what he and his mother had to endure during their stay at the town. He poured gasoline on the floor of the home and as Rygann woke up, Kegan told Rygann that he and all the other townspeople had killed his mother by slowly wearing her away with how they treated her and that he was now sending Kegan out to die. He then set the house on fire.
After burning himself in the fire that he started, Kegan walked away intending to leave Rygann's Reach and go into the wilderness. After getting on top of a hill, Kegan looked back and saw that the fire had spread throughout the entire settlement. Realizing that Zvanna's home had burned down, he ran back to find her. He found her dead body laying next to her family's bodies. After kneeling beside them for a time, he went into the wilderness to find another settlement.
Kegan wandered through the wilderness for weeks, hunting wildlife to survive. He had wandered into a cave hoping to wait out a blizzard when
Ryze
walked into the cave and healed him of his frostbite and his severe burns from the fire at Rygann's Reach. Ryze saw potential in Kegan and decided to take him as his apprentice.

The Burning Vengeance

After Kegan had been Ryze's apprentice for a time, they tracked down a World Rune, a magical artifact that could give the user a large amount of magical power. After obtaining it, Kegan chose to keep and use the World Rune for his own gain. The Rune transformed Kegan, making the creature who would eventually come to be known as Brand. A shadow of the man he once was, Brand began his search for more World Runes.

Appearance

Brand has burned grey and black skin. This skin is interrupted by an orange streak along his chest that eminates light. His hands and scalp are this same shade of orange and are continuously on fire. Crevices where his eyes and mouth would be are replaced with orange light. Brand wears nothing but a pair of brown pants with belts around each leg, with the lower half of these pants being burned off.

Personality

Kegan Rodhe was an angry man, bitter towards the denizens of Rygann's Reach for how they treated him and his mother. He had an explosive temper, often resorting to him yelling, or more often using violence at those who angered him.
After transforming into Brand, the World Rune took full control of Kegan's body, becoming a cataclysmic pyromaniac obsessed with gaining more power and burning the world to ash, seeing mortals as weak and wishing to rule as a god. He is obsessed with hunting down his vessel's former master
Ryze
, trying to tempt him to rule with the World-Runes' power alongside him, and taunting him when his apprentice Kala nearly gave in to the temptation of a World-Rune.

It is shown that Brand's personality was influenced by the World-Rune tempting Kegan to getting revenge on the world for how he had been treated, reducing Kegan to nothing more than the embodiment of his desire for vengeance.

Mage
: Kegan Rodhe was born with innate magical abilities, inherited from his mother whom used her magic to heal others. Kegan struggled to manifest his magic, but once he became Brand his magical abilities became significantly more powerful.
Fire Magic:
Brand is able to use magic to create and manipulate fire to his will, which has many uses, including burning his enemies and flammable material. The World Rune that Brand has in his possession leaves the magical potential of this ability almost limitless.
Magical skills:
Other than fire, Brand has at least a rudimentary understanding and talent for traditional magic.
Resistance:
Brand is impervious to damage from magical and traditional sources. So far, there is no known way to permanently kill him.

Relations

Rygann's Reach
Villagers

Since he was young, Kegan was ostracized by the villagers of Rygann's Reach for being a son of a reaver and therefore being a symbol of bad luck in the village, insulting him with the moniker "reaver-bastard". Throughout Kegan's life the villagers subjected him to constant physical and verbal abuse, causing him to develop an aggressive and resentful personality. After his mother's death, he wished to take out his hatred towards the village for not grieving her death after she had overworked herself to death for their sake, though he blamed Rygann for stoking their beliefs in the first place. After the villagers witnessed his role in Zvanna's death, they mocked him again as he left the village. Even after going his separate ways, Kegan's bitterness from all of the torment his fellows subjected to him never faded, which allowed the World-Rune to tempt him into becoming Brand, leaving Kegan's personality as nothing but his resentment towards the world.

Krezia Rodhe

Krezia is Kegan's mother, whom was also shunned and outcasted by the village. She wanted to resign herself and Kegan to their cruel treatment fearing that they would be exiled and left to die in the wilderness. Due to her paranoia, she tried to urge her son not to make things worse for the both of them, but he remained defiant and said he refused to be a coward like her. Despite her protectiveness towards her son, Krezia was also abusive towards Kegan due to him being a constant reminder of her husband and his crime which caused them both to be outcasts in the first place. Even so, Kegan grieved his mother's death and burned down Rygann's Reach to avenge her and the cruelty suffered by her alongside himself.

Zvanna

Kegan first met Zvanna at the age of thirteen. She was the only person in the village who treated him kindly, so the two developed a friendship which later became a romance, though their relationship didn't last as Zvanna split up with him and later married Malvir, disappointing Kegan as he had lost the love of the only person who cared about him. Zvanna later told Kegan about Old Rygann's decree to exiled, feeling saddened towards him and offering him food to help him survive, though Kegan refused as he wanted to die in his exile. Later, Kegan's attempt to burn down the village ended up accidentally killing Zvanna and her family in the collateral damage, and he felt heavy remorse for causing her death.

Old Rygann
[

Old Rygann perpetuated his people's beliefs that the Rodhe family was bad luck, playing a role in the abuse they were subjected to. He wished to exile both Krezia and Kegan but only kept them due to the former's abilities to heal the villagers. Once Krezia died, Rygann had Kegan exiled as he no longer had worth for the village. Of all the people whom mistreated him, Kegan hated Rygann the most due to his role in Krezia's death, so Kegan came to his hut, threatening him with a knife while admonishing him for the way he treated him and his mother, before using his lantern to burn down Rygann's hut and by extent the entire village to get revenge.

Ryze

Brand was once a student of Ryze when he was still known as Kegan Rodhe. After Brand's transformation, they became enemies, with Brand intent on finding and gaining possession of another World Rune, which directly conflicts with Ryze's objective of making sure that nobody can find or use any other World Runes again.
