Early Life

Born to the nomadic river folk of the Serpentine Delta, Tobias Felix quickly learned what it was to be an outsider. Tolerated for the exotic goods they peddled, but shunned for their strange traditions, his people found only short welcomes wherever they berthed their colorful river barques. His elders would shrug, and say this was just the way of the world, but the obvious prejudice always stuck in Tobias' craw.
He found his true calling in the gambling tents, between games of chance and skill like Mortwheel and Stabberscotch, when he first picked up a deck of playing cards. Many years earlier, his superstitious grandfather had shown him how to read omens in the shuffle and cut, while his aunt had later taught him how to read all an opponent's tells. Between the two, Tobias took to the high-stakes game of Krakenhand like an old master. He could almost feel each card's place in the deck, and follow their movements through each successive hand. He was often accused of cheating, but it was difficult for anyone to explain exactly how.
Finally, one night, a group of men who'd lost their fortunes to young Tobias returned in the dead of night to settle the score. They came bearing cudgels and, emboldened by cheap rotgut, went from tent to tent in their search for him, beating down any of the river folk who got in their way. Fearing for his life, Tobias turned and fled into the darkness.
When dawn came, the lad sheepishly crept back to find his people breaking down the camp. No one would look him in the eye. He had thought only of himself and left others to face the consequences of his actions.
Though he begged and pleaded with them all, Tobias was exiled for what he had done. With his whole world falling apart around him, he watched helplessly as the barques left, leaving him alone on the riverbank with nothing but his grandfather's worn deck of cards clutched in his hands.
He grew to manhood as a drifter, trawling the gambling halls of every settlement he came to, using his preternatural skill to earn enough coin to survive. That Tobias was able to relieve the boastful, the arrogant, and the cruel of their cash was just an added bonus—though he was always careful to let his marks win at least a few hands, here and there.
Across one table, he met a deplorable fellow named Malcolm Graves.
Each recognizing a kindred soul, Tobias and Graves quickly joined forces. On the southern borderlands of
Valoran
, they set two renowned noble houses of
Noxus
at each other’s throats as cover for the rescue of a kidnapped heir. That they pocketed the reward money, only to ransom the vile young man to the highest bidder, should really have come as no surprise to their original employer. In
Piltover
, they still hold the distinction of being the only thieves ever to crack the supposedly impenetrable Clockwork Vault. Not only did the pair empty the vault of all its treasures, they also tricked the guards into loading the loot onto their hijacked schooner, for a quick getaway through the Sun Gates.
In almost every case, only once they and their accomplices were safely over the horizon were their crimes even discovered—usually along with one of Twisted Fate’s trademark calling cards left where it would be easily found.
With every con, swindle, and heist, Tobias felt the pull of the cards growing stronger, and he knew it was more than mere gambler's luck that guided him. His people had always waved away concerns over primitive magic and “cartomancy”, but now Tobias began to seek out ever more dangerous means to bend the cards to his will.
That search ended badly Graves was taken alive and sent into The Locker while Tobias and the rest of the crew ran free. Though he tried to break Graves out, he failed. Instead, seeking to begin again, he returned his birth name to the river's waters and took another: Twisted Fate.

Burning Tides

Burning Tides

In the years after, Twisted Fate continued conning people solo, one-time evading capture by Miss Fortune. She would later hire him by proxy to sneak into Gangplank’s warehouse to steal and return a Crimson-Coil dagger, where he would reunite with Graves, who broke out from The Locker and was tipped off by the Bounty Hunter herself about Twisted Fate presence.
Flamed with rage at his partner's apparent betrayal, Graves started shooting at Tobias in an effort to settle the score with him. With Gangplank's warehouse burning and with the pirate captain's thugs swarming, the resolution of Graves' and Twisted Fate's long-simmering feud threatens to engulf the entire city in flames. Informed by the destruction of his warehouse, Gangplank set off the catch both of the perpetrators of this act.
Both Graves and Twisted Fate tried to flee from the wrath of the Pirate King but with no success. Gangplank tortured them until he tried to publicly execute them in front of the whole city for their misbehavior. Hearing the news of this event, Sarah Fortune's plans set in motion and along with her crew, started to make preparations to blow up Gangplank’s flagship so all Bilgewater could witness the death of their Reaver King.
Graves managed to hide one of Twisted Fate's cards, snatched during their previous fight around the city, from the pirate thugs, and so, Twisted Fate breaks free but Graves gets dragged to the bottom of the ocean. Twisted Fate then jumps after him and saves Graves from drowning but almost dies in the process. Graves manages to save Twisted Fate and after they successfully survive the explosion, both men settled their dispute and resolve to pick up their joint hustling.
As Graves had lost his shotgun Destiny, they head to Piltover so he can get a new one. Even though Graves and Twisted Fate are tempted to reconcile their relationship, both know it may take a while for Graves to completely trust Twisted Fate again, still, the latter is happy to have his old friend back.

Destiny and Fate

After running jobs in Piltover and Zaun for a while, they go back to Bilgewater in search of the Abyssal Crown. Along with the story, Twisted Fate actively tries to regain Graves' trust, staying despite the danger and giving the Crown to Graves since the latter still keeps some distance from him.
They end up angering a sea witch in the process. Later on Miss Fortune springs a trap for Twisted Fate and Graves. Despite the latter's success in cornering her, she manages to trap them and hand them to the sea witch in exchange for her quartermaster. In the end, she helps Twisted Fate and Graves escape as well.

Appearance

Twisted Fate is described as a tall, handsome male with tanned skin, trimmed beard and long dark hair. He's got sharp features and a strong jaw. He is usually depicted wearing a dandy wide-brimmed hat with golden ornaments along with a long black coat, a salmon vest, and a white button-up shirt with black tight pants and boots. Although he wears his hair loosely, in the
Double-Double Cross
cinematic he has shorter hair kept in a small ponytail and doesn’t wear his jacket.
His eye color remains inconsistent, being blue in some depictions and brown in others. T.F. also has a Bilgewater-themed tattoo on his right arm seen on his lore-based skin
Cutpurse Twisted Fate

Personality
[

edit source
]

Twisted Fate rarely takes things seriously, greeting each day with a mocking smile and an insouciant swagger. He’s prone to brag and has an overall smug yet charismatic personality. He's an opportunistic and hedonistic person that enjoys the thrill of danger and adventure. However, he does seem to have some roguish honor, since he tends to steal mostly from rich people and it is mentioned that he enjoyed conning arrogant and cruel people, as shown in his short story. Even though he usually appears laid-back and playful, he rarely shows genuine emotions and has tight control of his expressions.
Twisted Fate is analytical and a strategist, being the brains in his partnership with Graves, usually in charge of planning out heists. He’s also superstitious and theatrical, since it’s mentioned he enjoys putting on a show and communicates artistically at times.
He used to have a history of taking off when things started to get complicated but changed his ways after starting to work with Graves once again. Twisted Fate is also a stickler for appearance even having a “concerned face” he only uses when dealing with a really bad hand of cards or when he finds a new stain on his jacket. He’s very protective of his hat, to the point he checks the state of his hat first instead of his broken ribs after falling off a building. Twisted Fate is also plagued by the fact that he's a riverman that can't swim, drowning being his worst nightmare.

Mage
:
Tobias was born with natural magical abilities, which might grow the more he trains and expands his knowledge about magic.
Cartomancy:
Twisted Fate uses magical cards for various effects. His cards are a family heirloom and are specifically described as old magic. Without him having one to focus on, he can't cast magic at all, though it's unclear if the cards are magic or if they are only magical for him. Yellow cards stun and deals some damage, since Bambolini got some heavy bruising when Twisted Fate hit him with a yellow card. Red cards are know to explode but the blue card ability is still unknown.
Teleportation:
Twisted Fate is capable of teleportation from one place to another while gaining complete visual access while he casts the spell.
Divination
: like other riverfolks, Twisted Fate is able to read cards and look for omens among them.

Relations

Malcolm Graves
[

Their partnership started when they recognized a kindred soul in one another across a table during a high-stakes game in Mudtown.
They both shared the same reckless passion for danger and adventure, which is what encouraged them to form their partnership. Graves being the brawn, and T.F. being the brains they were an unusually effective team from the outset. Their mutual sense of roguish honor grew into genuine trust, and together they hustled across Valoran.
They were forced apart when a heist went south, with Graves getting sent to The Locker despite Twisted Fate’s efforts to save him. Graves endured years of torture and solitary confinement, during which time he nursed his bitter anger toward his old partner, and, convinced T.F. had betrayed him, Graves was determined to have his revenge.
Graves reunited with T.F. again when Miss Fortune set them up, yet they were forced to put aside their differences in order to escape almost certain death in the ongoing conflict between her and Gangplank. Even though Graves and T.F. were tempted to reconcile their relationship, both knew it may take a while for Graves to completely trust T.F. again, still, the latter was happy to have his old friend back.
However, since Graves still kept some distance from T.F., in the short story Destiny and Fate, T.F. proactively tries to show Graves that he can trust him again. T.F. had a history of taking off when things got ugly and so, T.F. wanted to stay and retrieve the Abyssal Crown even if it meant risking his life so he could prove to Graves that he wouldn't leave him to pick up the pieces anymore. In the same story, when Graves shows up next to T.F. bleeding, the latter notices and expresses his concern, something that Graves actually appreciated even if he didn't say it out loud.
During the Burning Tides events, T.F. jumps after Graves to save him from drowning despite not knowing how to swim and being terrified of drowning himself.
Graves seems to like messing with T.F., particularly by calling him Tobias instead of Twisted Fate insisting the latter is a stupid name, or by splashing him with salt water just to mess with TF's carefully oiled and perfumed hair. Similarly, T.F. usually comes up with clever replies to annoy Graves. Their petty bickering is seen many times like at the end of Burning Tides, Double-double cross, and Destiny and Fate.
In the story "The Boys and Bombolini" it is revealed that both Graves and Twisted Fate have romantic feelings for each other.

Yordles

After some time, Graves captured
Teemo
for the bounty on
yordles
while Twisted Fate refuses because "messing with Yordles brings a whole heap of trouble." Graves then fought
Corki
,
Lulu
and
Tristana
who came to save Teemo, which ended up in Graves being

into a frog and the Yordles escaping.
