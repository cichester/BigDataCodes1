Life as a
Reckoner

Xin Zhao was born in Ionia, raised on a fisherman's ship named Viscero. One day, they ended up crossing into the waters of
Noxus
, where a Noxian ship captured them and took them to Noxus. Unfamiliar with this new land, Xin Zhao rose above the ranks with his expert spearmanship, so Noxus offered him a chance to live a better life. He reluctantly accepted and entered the arenas of the
Reckoners
and took the name Viscero after his first home.
Viscero was a famous warrior amongst the arena, with the crowd cheering for the carnage he inflicted while the other Reckoners grew to fear him. But eventually,
Boram Darkwill
made a decree to privately free Noxian mercenaries, prisoners or Reckoners (Xin Zhao included) to send them to fight for Noxus in other nations. Xin Zhao was transported to
Demacia
, where he faced against many Demacian soldiers. Most of his fellow Reckoners ran away, but Xin Zhao refused to give up. When he was confronted by soldiers, he welcomed them to execute him, but he was instead spared and imprisoned. At his request, Xin Zhao was taken to meet their king,
Jarvan III
.

Meeting
Jarvan III

While his guard
Tianna
repeatedly threatened him, Jarvan III was more easygoing and listened to him. After their conversation, he offered Xin Zhao a bag of money to go back to his real home, but since Demacia had shown him the true meaning of the ideals he strove for, he wanted to join his guard (to Tianna's shock). He asked how Xin Zhao could prove he was capable, so he snatched a guard's spear and fought off the guards before pointing the spear at the king's throat. He apologized and prepared to get killed, but Jarvan III forgave him and accepted him into his ranks. Tianna was still distrustful of him, but Xin Zhao swore an oath to her that if something happened to Jarvan III, she would kill him by her own hand. Xin Zhao grew to become very close friends with Jarvan III (even being adopted into the Lightshield family), and taught Prince Jarvan IV to raise him into an honorable king. He believed that Demacia was where he truly belonged, serving them not for duty, but his own choice.

Pilgrimage


More than thirty years after leaving the land of his birth, Xin Zhao found a seed in the royal gardens of Demacia that he tended into a sapling and was shocked to see it bloomed with Ionian spirit blossoms, which were believed to never fall beyond the First Lands. On the advice of his liege-lord Jarvan, Xin Zhao sailed halfway across the world to the
Navori
province of Ionia, taking a royal vessel and guards with him in search of answers. At the Spirit Blossom Festival, Xin Zhao met
Kennen
of the
Kinkou Order
, who was initially displeased that the Seneschal had brought a weapon into the holy festival. Still, Kennen could see something was troubling Xin and filled him in on all that had happened in Ionia during his absence:
the Noxian invasion
, and the occupation, during which time not a single blossom bloomed. Kennen also discussed with Xin Zhao the
Tale of the Devoted Shrine Maiden
, who followed her patron spirit into exile after the War of the False Kanmei. Kennen then invited Xin Zhao to the Kinkou
Temple of Koeshin
, where he planted the sapling in Ionian soil at the top of the steps.

The Battle of Koeshin

As Xin Zhao and Kennen were meditating at the top of the mountain, they were interrupted by a magical surge that heralded an invasion by
demonkin
from the
spirit realm
. As Kennen left to speak with Masters
Shen
and
Mayym
, Xin went to fight the creatures on his own. During the battle, he was unexpectedly aided by another Kinkou warrior named
Yunara
, and he learned of a second, secret temple on the mountain known as the Temple of Twilight. The two of them fought back against the demons and their leader, a demonic pretender who took the form of the
Grovemother
from Ionian folklore. Their battles with the pretender led them to defend the villagers, as other
wicked forces
stalked the forests around them.
At the end of the conflict, Xin Zhao and Yunara had successfully slain the pretender, though the spear given to him by
King Jarvan
was broken in the process. They left to confer with Kennen, and though Yunara demanded to speak with Shen, Kennen simply reacted with shock upon seeing her, as her post had been abandoned. Shortly after, a bell rang from the Temple of Twilight, signalling the wards had been breached. As Kennen and Yunara left to investigate, Xin Zhao inquired about the stairs they were taking. Kennen invited him to follow where they led, and Yunara warned him that their "true test" lay ahead of them.

Great Mage Rebellion

One day, Jarvan III sent Xin Zhao on a mission of critical importance, so he left. By the time he got back, a
mage rebellion
led by
Sylas of Dregbourne
broke out and Jarvan III had been killed. Xin Zhao felt enormous guilt for his mistake, believing it was his own fault Jarvan III died. Jarvan IV requested Xin Zhao for a training spar, where he vented all of his grief and anger towards Xin Zhao for leaving his father to die. When Jarvan IV broke down in tears for the loss of his father, Xin Zhao comforted him. Afterwards, Jarvan IV told Xin Zhao to burn the letter he was meant to deliver, as it was a request for Jarvan III to the leader of the
Mageseekers
to be more accepting of mages, but since Jarvan IV grew to hate mages due to believing Sylas and his mages to have killed his father. Xin Zhao reluctantly followed the prince's request and burned the letter, accepting what was to come.
With all of the civil unrest in Demacia, Xin Zhao was needed more than ever. With Jarvan IV forced to take the mantle as king, Xin Zhao swore his loyalty to him and promised to guide him for the days to come.

Personality

Xin Zhao is a disciplined warrior and fiercely loyal. Having endured a life of hardship, he does not hesitate when called to battle. However, he much prefers the virtuous ideals of Demacia over the needless death and brutality of the Noxian fighting pits. Despite being a fearsome combatant, confident in his martial prowess, he often speaks gently and has an aura of calm. Still, he can show aggression and anger when confronted by his enemies or those who wish to do harm. Overall, he is a thoughtful and conscientious individual who fights primarily to protect the weak and the innocent.

Skilled Melee Combatant:
Xin Zhao was a skilled melee combatant who was one of the most formidable
Reckoners
in all of
Noxus
. His martial prowess made him an unmatched duelist, and it was rumored that Xin Zhao had never once been defeated in one-on-one combat. Xin Zhao was able to translate these skills on the battlefield and held his own against even the elite forces of the
Dauntless Vanguard
, though they eventually were able to defeat him with their superior numbers.
Three Talon Spear:
Xin Zhao's weapon of choice was a three talon spear which he could
charge
with and
slash
in a crescent motion around him. He was already proficient with this weapon as a young man, and his mastery of these techniques made
"Viscero"
a celebrated name across the empire. Currently, Xin Zhao uses these skills in service to
House Lightshield
, the royal family of
Demacia
.
