Childhood

Rell Canwell was born in
Qualthala
to a
Noxian
footsoldier and Lady Dahlia of
House Canwell
, a lower noble family that had fallen into hardship during the reign of
Boram Darkwill
. At some point, Rell's father was wounded and discharged from the military, and her mother gradually lost money and status. Their difficult situation only became worse after Rell came along. As she was growing up, Rell learned to ride horses at her mother's estate in the
Bloodcliffs
, and became especially skilled at this from a young age. They lost this estate, and as their family fell out of favor, Rell was forced to move to the slums of
Bel'zhun
, where her parents believed they would find more "opportunity."
In the Barrel, as the locals of Bel'zhun referred to their poorer neighborhood, Rell and her parents lived in an old
Shuriman
apartment building which they shared with several other families. Rell frequently got into fights with other kids, and in time she became very good at it. On one occasion, Rell's mother caught her when she nearly killed someone with a broomstick, and for that, Lady Canwell punished her severely. This did not deter Rell from fighting, and when she was with her friends, Rell would sneak into the Bel'zhun arena to watch the
Reckoners
from the penny stands. Rell became a big fan of the games, and though her parents refused to let her fight, they changed their minds when they discovered that the winner would receive large sum of prize money.

Reckoner of Bel'zhun

Rell's excitement about becoming a
Reckoner
faded as her parents trained her relentlessly to become their fighter in the arena, where she would battle skillfully with a spear on horseback and learned to win at any cost. During her training, Rell was no longer allowed to see her friends. Whenever she lost a match, her parents would call her worthless. Whenever she won, the Canwells would take her prize money and spend it all on clothes and drinks to attend parties with the socialites of Bel'zhun's upper stratosphere. When the day arrived that she defeated the arena's champion, a
basilisk
rider named Navus, the Canwells continued to scold and argue with her. Rell had grown to resent her parents, so when
Ambessa Medarda
came to their family's home with an offer to join her elite warband for a campaign, Rell immediately accepted, despite the Canwells' protests.

When
Ambessa
and her lieutenant
Rictus
picked her up from her home, Rell learned the general was currently in conflict with her cousin Ta'Fik, the steward of
Tereshni
, over their disputed claims of leadership to
House Medarda
. In the midst of this civil war, Rell began work as Ambessa's aide, and was promised that once she was ready, she would be allowed to fight on the battlefield. Rell had been hoping for an adventure when she decided to join them, but the minute she stepped onto the general's flagship, the lack of solid ground left her so seasick and nauseous that she immediately regretted her decision to leave
Bel'zhun
. Rell stayed below decks with the horses, claiming it was the closest thing she had to land. Rictus helped acclimate her to the voyage, and the ship's captain, Zishani, had Rell fitted with new armor and a spear.
After over a week of sailing, their ships were attacked by forces from
Trannit
, whose steward had allied with Ta'Fik. Their ship sank and they were captured, but four of them—including Rell, Ambessa, Rictus, and a
vastaya
named Caprian—managed to escape Steward Smik on stolen horses to the mountains in the north. Although Rell wanted to return for the rest of their warband, Ambessa argued that her soldiers were a necessary loss, and her strength in sacrificing them would help them to achieve victory in the war. To this end, it would be best to head for the
Immortal Bastion
, where they would deliver the vastaya and enlist the help of Grand General
Boram Darkwill
.
For the next two months, their group made a harrowing trek into the mountains of the
Great Barrier
. Rell began her training with Ambessa and Rictus, who taught her matters of survival and combat. They lived off rabbits and fended off wild drakehounds until at last, they were rescued by a
Vindoran
scouting party, who brought them to the city in the north.

The Riders of Vindor
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Rell was excited to be in Vindor, which was home to the
Light Vindorans
, among the many legendary horse breeds in
Noxus
. Steward Amenesce, who was neutral in the Medarda conflict, had been impressed with Rell's ability to fight drakehounds on horseback and she offered to give her a day of lessons. Rell leapt at the opportunity to train with the empire's foremost horsewoman, to which Ambessa gave her reluctant approval. At the stables, Rell experienced one her happiest days in a long time as she rode a Vindoran steed with Steward Amenesce. She also met a confident young stablehand named Tora, a talented rider and archer who was soon to join Amenesce's warband of elite scouts. Rell developed an obvious crush on Tora, and when the time came to set sail again for the Noxian capital, she was not ready to say goodbye to her. A blockade by Ta'Fik's allies prevented them from sailing out the harbor, so Ambessa took her warband of three on Amenesce's
swifthorns
instead. Amenesce and her cavalries, including Tora, accompanied them as new allies, as the city's neutrality had not been respected by Ta'Fik. As they rode, Rell finally felt she was having the adventure she was promised.
When they reached the Noxian capital over a month later, Rell and Ambessa went to prepare for the Grand General's tribute: a palace ball which would be held the following week. As they were shopping for fabrics at Nika Fallow's shop, Ambessa asked Rell about her ambitions. Rell had grown closer to Tora in the past month, and after confiding in Ambessa about this, the general warned her that "entanglements" could become a snare around one's heart, and that she should be careful about trusting the people close to her. This advice upset Rell greatly, causing Ambessa to backpedal slightly on what she had said. Rell also confessed that she hated how her parents had pushed her, used her, and molded her into their weapon without caring who she was. Ambessa promised Rell that as a mentor, she would be different from the Canwells.
At Darkwill's palace, Rell witnessed spectacle like she had never seen before. Nobles dressed in military attire. Walls painted in magic and gold. The Noxian Grand General sat at the center of it all as the leaders of the
Great Houses
offered him tribute. Rell made sure to bow at the throne beside Ambessa as she offered Caprian to Darkwill, after which Amenesce informed them that Ta'Fik had sent soldiers to invade Ambessa's home city of
Rokrund
. To aid in the city's defense, their forces made the long journey south on Amenesce's swifthorns.

The Ambush
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Rell accompanied Ambessa, Rictus, and Steward Amenesce on swifthorns to the
Varju Mountains
, where they prepared an ambush in the pass for the forces from Trannit who were marching to intercept them. As Rell hid behind the rocks, Rictus spoke to her to see if she was prepared, as she had never been on the battlefield, nor had she ever killed anyone. Rell claimed that she understood fighting from her time as a
Reckoner
, and secretly, she felt excited for the opportunity to put her training to good use. Rictus, however, explained that what she was about to experience would be completely different from the arena, and that she must be prepared and alert for what was to come. After this, Rell spoke to Tora, who gifted her a good luck charm: A necklace of a shard from the first shoe of her first horse. They took their positions, and when Smik's men arrived, they sprang their trap.
When the battle began, Rell found herself completely unprepared. It was a chaotic and nauseating experience, with every foe she struck down only being replaced by another, with no end in sight and no chance to celebrate her victory. Rell thought it was a nightmare, and was ashamed of her wish to run to Ambessa for help. Narrowly, she survived being killed by a soldier the size of Rictus, whose face would continue to haunt her after the battle. It ended quickly when Smik fell to Ambessa's
drakehound blades
, after which Rell ran outside the pass where she could be alone and hide the fact that she was crying. Tora found her there, looking equally shaken, and Ambessa found them too. Though she could see the fear on Rell's face, Ambessa simply asked to see her hands, which were covered in the enemy's blood. Ambessa saw the blood and told Rell that she had done well.

Iron and Vengeance
[
edit
|
edit source
]


After a month of crossing the Varjus, Rell, Rictus, and Ambessa regrouped with the forces of Rokrund and prepared another attack, this one against Ta'Fik's
rune-soldiers
occupying the Rokrund saltpetre mines. The force was led by his eldest daughter Gintara, and as they prepared their ambush in the forest, Rell was there at the general's side. The rune soldiers quickly overwhelmed them, but when it seemed Rell and Ambessa were about to be killed by Gintara's
basilisk
, Rell screamed so loudly that all the metal in the area vibrated, became heavier, and was pressed against the ground. Just as suddenly, the basilisk screamed as well as its armor crumpled, and the creature found itself crushed from within. With Rictus's help, they brought the wounded Ambessa to safety, and Rell led the retreat of their forces back to their camp.
After the battle, Rell was confused about what had happened, as it had occurred quickly and by sheer instinct. She spoke to Rictus about it, and they both came to the realization that she was a
mage
with the ability to
manipulate metal
. Rictus encouraged Rell to share her discovery with Ambessa, and she went to visit her at the medical station. Once again, Rell was ashamed of how afraid she was during the battle, but she managed to cheer up with encouragement and revealed her powers to Ambessa, demonstrating her "ferromancy" by reshaping a metal spear. Ambessa was impressed by this, and she later approached Rell with a plan to defend Rokrund Citadel from Gintara's offensive. At the gates, Rell attempted to use her powers, but struggled to properly control them and ended up overexerting herself, sending shards of metal flying dangerously toward foes and allies with deadly effect. Even so, Rell managed to hold on long enough for Amenesce's cavalry to arrive, and she managed to entrap Gintara within metal cuffs so that Ambessa's army could take the enemy leader hostage. Inside the citadel, an exhausted Rell and Rictus accompanied Ambessa as she spoke with the prisoner in one of the rooms. Gintara mocked and attempted to goad Ambessa into killing her, claiming that her father and sister would avenge her, and that Ambessa's family members wouldn't do the same for her. After leaving, Rell left to recover her strength, but quietly assured Ambessa that she would avenge her if she were to be killed.
The next day, Rell had gotten word that Ambessa's husband
Azizi
had been killed in
Bel'zhun
, and that she suspected Ta'Fik was the one responsible. Ambessa brought Rell to the room with Gintara and gave her a choice:
She
would be allowed to decide the prisoner's fate. Rell was confused, as she had thought the plan was to hold Gintara for ransom, but Ambessa informed her that Ta'Fik had a second daughter in Bel'zhun that they could capture for this purpose. After hearing this, Rell reasoned that they didn't need two hostages, and if they killed Gintara then it would both avenge Azizi's death and send an appropriate message to Ta'Fik regarding the fate of his second daughter. Ambessa agreed with Rell and ordered her to execute Gintara with her knife. Rell was shocked and hesitated, but ultimately, she obeyed her general.

Kidnapping
[
edit
|
edit source
]

After passing Ambessa's test and washing the blood from her hands, Rell was offered a Medarda ring from Ambessa. As she had proven herself capable of making a decisive and difficult choice, Rell could be adopted as one of Ambessa's children to one day lead the clan alongside them. Rell was instantly suspicious that this was about her powers, believing she was otherwise unworthy of leading a warband, much less being part of a Great House. Ambessa assured Rell that this was not the case, and she also gifted Rell a silver brooch in the shape of the
Wolf
. After some hesitation, Rell accepted the ring, on the condition that Ambessa would continue training her.
That night, a feast was held in celebration of a successful defense of the citadel the day before. Steward Katye personally thanked Rell for the role she had played in the battle, and though she felt out of place in the festivities, Tora offered Rell a dance, and she accepted. As they were making up moves and tripping over themselves, Rell finally felt happy and free for the first time in a while, forgetting about the bloodshed, her magic, and the Medarda name. Then she saw Ambessa in the distance, and she felt Gintara's blood on her hands. Noticing her shift in mood, Tora took Rell out to the courtyard for some fresh air, where Rell confided in Tora about her frustrations, her parents, and her suspicions that Ambessa only wanted her for her magic. Rell gifted Tora an arrowhead made from iron in her armor, and Tora reassured her that she had nothing to worry about. They shared a kiss by the gardens, which was interrupted by
Ambessa
, who said she needed to speak with Rell privately for a moment. Tora left the two of them alone, and Rell, none the wiser, began to follow the general out of the Medarda compound.
As they reached a dark, unpopulated street, Rell finally realized that something was off.
"Ambessa"
smiled wickedly as several
cloaked figures
emerged behind her, and before Rell could react or run away, she was blasted unconscious by magic, with the only trace of her being the silver Wolf clasp left behind on the road.

Imprisonment
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Rell woke up being carried through a dark, dank corridor which bore a disturbing resemblance to the
Bel'zhun
Reckoner Arena
. As some time had passed since she was taken by her captors, Rell eventually realized that the person she followed in
Rokrund
was not
Ambessa
, but was confused as to why Ambessa had not come to rescue her yet, remembering the general's promise to protect her. Rell's captor, a woman with sharp teeth, would use magic to shock her every time she was disobedient, and when they reached the end of the corridor, Rell found herself in the "training yard", where a young pyromancer, Saida, was waiting to duel against her, with the only rule they were given being to win and be rewarded, or suffer a severe punishment. Rell attempted to escape by hurling a chunk of iron at the woman, but she easily blocked the attack. Rell also attempted to join forces with Saida, but the other girl refused, seemingly resigned to obeying their mistress's orders.
After a short duel, Rell defeated Saida by building a
metal steed
and
lance
and then sealing the pieces around her opponent as a metal coffin. The woman watching them congratulated Rell, and although she wanted to celebrate, she became acutely aware of the intense sadness and fear on Saida's face afterwards as they were led into a chamber with two tables. Rell attempted to flee, but was forcibly strapped to the table next to her. Rell apologized to Saida, who smiled sadly before the magic was ripped from her body and burned into a rune on Rell's skin, in a process that was excruciatingly painful for both of them. Rell cursed the woman who ran the procedure, who coldly welcomed her to the
Black Rose
and sent her back to the dungeon.
In her cell, Rell was allowed to wash herself with a sponge and soap. She looked at the catatonic Saida, then at the rune burned onto her arm. She vowed to carry both their pain so that when she finally escaped, she would rescue as many as she could from the prison and get vengeance on the Black Rose, and on
Noxus
itself for letting such horrors happen in their empire.

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Rell is a dark-skinned teenage girl with yellow eyes and white blonde hair with some highlights of yellow. She typically wears a light suit of armor with leather pads on the shoulders, hips and knees. Her left hand has a torn arm sleeve with leather padding, while her right arm is sleeveless and covered in pieces of metal branding her with magical sigils. She wields her metal lance in her right hand and makes it glow a deep orange-yellow whenever she heats it up. Her mount is a metal construct shaped into the form of a horse thanks to her ferromancy magic.
When Rell leaps off of her mount, she reshapes it into an even heavier set of metal armor that goes over her current outfit. Her heavy metal armor has a massive chest plate, knee guards, pieces of metal floating at the sides of her legs and a huge, spiked shoulder guard on her left shoulder.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Before she was turned into a weapon by the
Black Rose
, Rell lived a difficult life in
Bel'zhun
, enduring both poverty and parents whom she felt did not respect her as a person. As she was just a teenager, Rell had a "volatile" temper that her parents believed made her challenging to be around, often shifting between excitable and restless, to sullen and rebellious, and she cursed and got into fights frequently with others her age. Rell was eager to leave Bel'zhun with
Ambessa
, believing this was a chance to use her aggression and skills as a
Reckoner
to have a real adventure. When Ambessa spoke with Valif at the Any Port tavern in Bel'zhun, Rell ate almost all the food at the table by herself. Rell's deep admiration of Ambessa, as well as her willingness to learn from the general, led her to ask so many questions that Ambessa found it annoying. As a page in Ambessa's army, Rell was deeply protective of her comrades, forming connections with
Rictus
, Captain Zishani, and Tora, and in
Trannit
, her first instinct was to go back and rescue their captured soldiers, but Ambessa ultimately decided to leave them behind. Rell was also unable to hide whenever she was attracted to someone, becoming hopelessly awkward and flustered around Tora shortly after she had just met her.
After her first battle, Rell was significantly traumatized after fearing for her life, and felt physically nauseous after being forced to kill enemy combatants for the first time. Later, when Ambessa forced her to personally execute Gintara, Rell still felt the blood on her hands long after she had washed it off. By the time the Black Rose started to turn her into their weapon, Rell had grown fully disillusioned with
Noxus
for the horrors they allowed to happen in their empire, ranging from the politics to the people and even the very land itself. Rell's distrustful attitude—a result of the upbringing—made her aggressive and vengeful, and the experimental procedures she endured only increased her willingness to tear apart everyone who had wronged her. Rell became fiercely protective of the other subjects held captive by the Rose and sought to avenge their suffering as well, with the runes burned onto her skin serving as a reminder of the pain they shared and her guilt in defeating them in combat.

Abilities
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Mage
:
Rell was born with potent and rare natural magic abilities that were of special interest to the
Black Rose
.
Rune Sigils:
Due to the Black Rose's nightmarish experiments, Rell has been branded with flesh runes which were created through the forcible extraction of magic from other young mages, whom she had been forced to defeat in combat. These runes, once branded on Rell's skin through a painful procedure, enhance her magic even further and instantly give her further strength and control of her abilities.
[
1
]
Ferromancy:
Rell possesses the ability to manipulate metal, an incredibly strong power rarely seen in Runeterra. She is capable of ripping ore straight from the ground, superheating metal, twisting it into different shapes and even crushing opponents with their own armor. The first time Rell used her abilities, she was able to crush a
basilisk
within its armor through sheer instinct after it nearly killed her.
[
1
]
Metal Mount and Armor:
Rell has precise control over her abilities and is capable of manipulating metal into the shape of her signature steed that she rides across Noxus, stomping on and crushing anyone in her way. Along with that, she can use this same arrangement of metal pieces to form an impenetrable suit of black armor around herself.
Horseback Rider:
Rell is a gifted horseback rider, able to move with her mounts effortlessly, and is able to easily prevent them from panicking in the face of deadly creatures, like
drakehounds
or
basilisks
. Rell was able to translate these skills to riding other mounts, including
Vindoran
swifthorns
and her own, custom-made
metal steeds
formed using her ferromancy.
[
1
]
Combat Mastery:
As a former champion of the
Bel'zhun
Reckoner Arena
, Rell received relentless training from her mother and father to be incredibly tough and resilient in combat. When she was recruited into the Wolf's Reapers, her raw skills were honed by
Ambessa
and
Rictus
, who practiced with her while teaching lessons in ruthlessness and strategic awareness.
[
1
]
Metal Lance:
While her original weapon of choice was a spear (which she could throw with pinpoint accuracy to puncture a tree), Rell would switch to using a metal lance after discovering her ferromancy, which she often forms in tandem with a metal horse. Like all metal, Rell is capable of superheating her lance in order to strike with even more force.

Relations
[

]

The Canwells
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Rell had a tense and bitter relationship with her parents, having suffered emotional and verbal abuse at their hands. Rell's parents claimed that her "volatile" nature, on account of the fights she would get into as a child, made her difficult to work with, and Rell believed they saw her as a burden on their family after they fell into financial hardship. As their champion in the arena, Rell's parents trained her relentlessly, forbid her from seeing her friends, verbally abused her whenever she did poorly, and continued to berate her even when she had won, while taking all of her prize money for themselves to spend on drinks and clothes to attend high-society parties. Rell recognized that her parents were only using her for her abilities as a fighter and leapt at the first opportunity she had to get away from them, despite their many protests. Long after she had left
Bel'zhun
, Rell still remembered all the hurtful things they had said to her whenever she failed or showed cowardice, and it made her deathly afraid of disappointing her general,
Ambessa Medarda
.
[

Ambessa Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Rell was one of the many
Reckoners
scouted out by Ambessa in the arenas who were eventually recruited to join her elite warband, the Wolf's Reapers. Ambessa watched Rell's rise for an entire year until she defeated the arena's champion in
Bel'zhun
; an event which nearly coincided with Menelik's death and the start of the
Medarda
civil war. As Ambessa made plans to flee the city, she decided to take Rell with her, to the chagrin of the Canwells used their daughter's prize money as a source of income. Rell, on the other hand, was simply excited to get away from her parents. On the journey, Ambessa and
Rictus
became Rell's mentors, training her in matters of survival as they crossed the
Great Barrier
. From the beginning, Rell looked up to her general as a source of inspiration, but was also fearful of her, describing her as admirable and "generous", but also "exacting." While shopping in the
capital
, Ambessa warned Rell about her attachments to her loved ones and taught her much about the merciless, sacrificial ways of the
Wolf
and
House Medarda
. Rell worried frequently about disappointing her general. She was ashamed of the fear she felt on the battlefield and thought Ambessa would admonish her for it, but Ambessa was simply pleased that Rell's hands were covered in the enemy's blood.
After several months of journeying together, Ambessa and Rell grew to care for each other deeply. Rell's powers of ferromancy manifested as a direct result of Ambessa protecting her from Gintara's
basilisk
, which nearly killed them both. After this, Ambessa became interested in weaponizing Rell's new abilities, which made Rell worry that Ambessa would start using her as her parents had during her time as a
Reckoner
. After Rell passed the same test Ambessa had given
Mel
with
Lady Mion
—in which Rell personally executed the prisoner in question—Ambessa offered to adopt her as one of her children so that she could help Mel and
Kino
to lead the Medarda clan one day, and although Rell hesitated, she accepted on the condition that Ambessa would continue to train her. Before the decision could be made official, however, Rell was abducted by the
Black Rose
, with
LeBlanc
disguising herself as Ambessa to lure Rell away. Rell was held in captivity for a long time, and by the time they started experimenting on her, she believed Ambessa and everyone else she knew had already moved on and forgotten about her. She remembered Ambessa's teachings about vengeance, and carried this with her as she planned to tear the cabal and all of
Noxus
apart.
[

Rictus
[
edit
|
edit source
]


As another former
Reckoner
recruited into
Ambessa's
elite warband, Rell looked up to Rictus as a mentor and a role model, and even claimed she aspired to be like him one day. Rell and Rictus did not interact much at first, on account of his stoic and untalkative nature, but after traveling together for months through the deadly mountains of the
Great Barrier
and training with him during this time, Rell considered him a loyal friend and greatly appreciated his guidance. Rictus taught Rell about strategic awareness and he came to care for her greatly. Privately, he claimed that she was "strong" and was silently encouraging and supportive of her budding relationship with Tora, though Rell was unable to understand what he was trying to say to her at the time. Later, Rictus was the first person she spoke to after her powers of ferromancy manifested, and he also vouched for the good instincts she showed in leading their retreat.
Rictus was the one who suggested that Ambessa should adopt Rell, as he believed she was more than capable of leading
House Medarda
alongside
Mel
and
Kino
. When Rell was kidnapped by the
Black Rose
, Rictus wanted to save her as soon as possible, but obeyed Ambessa when she chose to confront Ta'Fik first. He and Ambessa later found Inyene's laboratory empty, with no sign of Rell anywhere.

Tora
[
edit
|
edit source
]

As she was serving in
Ambessa's
army, Rell met Tora in
Vindor
and almost instantly developed a crush on her. Tora was strong and confident, charming, and an excellent rider and archer, and Rell admired all these traits. During the next month of travel to the
Immortal Bastion
on
swifthorns
, Rell and Tora grew closer, with Rell working hard to impress Tora with her spear-throwing skills after seeing her catch a deer with an arrow through the heart. Rell was recognizably flustered and awkward around Tora, and she privately hated how she was unable to keep cool around her. Ambessa later spoke to Rell warning her about her "entanglements", as Tora had a reputation for breaking the hearts of young women in Vindor, which led Rell to become deeply upset that Ambessa did not trust someone whom she was genuinely fond of. Rell's first real battle in the
Varju Mountain pass
was also Tora's first, and as they prepared their ambush, Tora gave Rell a memento: a good luck charm made from the first shoe of her first horse. Tora claimed Rell needed it more than her, after which Rell affectionately called her a "show off". After a deeply traumatic experience on the battlefield, Rell and Tora privately found each other, both shaken and upset, and Tora helped comfort her.
At the
Medarda
compound in
Rokrund Citadel
, Rell and Tora celebrated a successful defense of the city together at the ballroom feast, where they danced together despite not knowing the steps, teased one another, and finally shared a kiss in the courtyard. Rell confided in Tora about Ambessa's plans to adopt her into the clan, as well as her reservations about Ambessa potentially only being interested in turning her into a weapon. Tora reassured her that Ambessa was admirable, and that she had nothing to worry about. Shortly after, Rell was led away by a
fake Ambessa
and kidnapped. Tora was inconsolable after learning this the following morning. Rell, however, never saw her reaction, and by the time the
Black Rose
began experimenting on her, she believed Tora had already forgotten about her and was happily living her life without her back in Vindor.

Black Rose
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Rell was kidnapped in
Rokrund
by
LeBlanc
, after the Pale Woman used magic to disguise herself as
Ambessa Medarda
. LeBlanc's wicked smile, which appeared over Ambessa's face, unnerved Rell to such an extent that she realized it wasn't the general, but it was too late as three other sorcerers attacked her in the alleyway. Rell was forcibly taken to a facility with an arena which bore a disturbing resemblance to the
Reckoner Arena
in
Bel'zhun
where she used to fight. Here, the Black Rose forced her into combat against other young mages under threat that if she lost, she would face severe punishment. After each victory, Rell found not joy but instead more horror, as she and her opponents were placed in an extraordinarily painful procedure. This was done with the intent of forging Rell into a weapon for their ends, and Rell was forced to live with the trauma and the guilt. After just the first duel, the Rose had already made Rell into their enemy, and she vowed to escape and destroy them for what they had done to her and the other mages.

The Null
[
edit

edit source
]

When Rell was first kidnapped by the
Black Rose
, she and another girl named Saida were forced into combat against one another, with Rell ultimately coming out victorious. Immediately after the battle, the two of them were forcibly strapped onto laboratory tables and forced to undergo a intense and painful procedure, where all of Saida's magic was ripped out of her and burned into a runic sigil on Rell's arm. Saida's eyes followed her lifelessly, and Rell felt intense guilt, suddenly wishing that she hadn't won the battle. Even so, she felt she did not have a choice but to keep fighting her opponents, as otherwise,
she
would be the one Nullified. Later in her cell, Rell washed herself off and examined the rune, treating it as a reminder of the now "Nulled" Saida. She vowed to rescue as many of the Null as she could from the Black Rose so that when she escaped, she could avenge them all.
