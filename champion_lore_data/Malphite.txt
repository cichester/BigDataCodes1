Origin and Creation
[

edit source

Malphite was originally created as part of a monumental project by the
Ixtali
elemental mage Ne'Zuk, who sought to combat the destructive forces of the
Void
. Ne'Zuk crafted a massive fortress, known as the Monolith, made from stone and elemental magic. This fortress was designed to act as a barrier, a weapon, and a last line of defense against the Void's corrupting influence. Malphite was created as a guardian entity within this fortress.
However, the Monolith was not simply a structure of stone; it was a living being that possessed incredible elemental power, a living vessel of elemental stone and magic. Ne'Zuk’s creation was part of an ambitious plan to neutralize the Void, but, despite the immense power of the Monolith, the plan ultimately failed. The Void forces were too overwhelming, and the Monolith itself was shattered in the conflict.

Shattering and Fragmentation

As the Monolith was destroyed, Malphite became the last surviving fragment of it. The battle against the Void tore the Monolith apart, and what was left of Malphite was scattered across Runeterra. For centuries, Malphite lay in a dormant, fragmented state, with his essence locked away in the ruins of the shattered Monolith. His body remained broken, but his spirit remained, lingering with a sense of purpose to continue fighting the Void.

Awakening

Malphite’s regeneration began when the shards of the Monolith slowly started to reconnect. This fragment of him grew aware of its surroundings, with memories of the Monolith’s destruction and the threat of the Void. His awakened form is much more colossal, resembling a massive golem-like figure of stone and living magic, but still marked by the deep cracks and fractures that come from the shattering of his original form.

The Void and His Purpose
[

The Void's influence continues to haunt Malphite. He sees the Void as an existential threat to all of existence, including his own. His consciousness is shaped by this overwhelming desire to stop the Void, even if it means sacrificing his very existence. He embodies the raw elemental energy of stone, yet he is not just an inert, mindless force. Malphite is driven by a will to protect the world, even though it is a world that often seems to have forgotten the ancient threats.
Although Malphite is a construct of stone and magic, he has an emotional core that shapes his personality. He is lonely, as he was alone for so long in the aftermath of the Monolith’s destruction, and he is often plagued by doubt. He struggles with the loss of the Monolith, questioning if there is any hope for the world or if it is too late to stop the Void. His solitude is made even more poignant by his inability to find others like him, as he is the last remnant of his kind.
He became an elemental force, still carrying the mission of protecting the world from the Void, even though the original Monolith’s destruction and the loss of his fellow constructs left him with a profound sense of isolation. His mission, to prevent the Void from infiltrating the world again, is all that keeps him moving forward.

Malphite is a walking mountain, a rough assembly of stone and earth, sometimes featuring sparse patches of plant life. It is vaguely human-shaped, with enormously broad, bulky shoulders and a hunched posture. It has four-fingered hands, three-toed feet, and a relatively small head with eyes and a mouth that glow green. It features numerous upward-facing spikes resembling craggy mountain peaks on its head, back, forearms, and knees.

Personality

Stoic yet easygoing, Malphite is fond of making quaint observations. It is extremely friendly to mortals as well as other stone golems, who it often regards as family. However, it can become aggressive when necessary, unleashing the unstoppable force of its awesome might against its enemies. Acutely aware of its giant size and strength, Malphite is a protector of
Runeterra
, standing stalwart against the forces of
the Void
whom it was created to combat.
