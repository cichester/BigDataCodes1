Early Life
[

Orianna was born the daughter of
Dr. Corin Reveck
, a renowned
Piltovan
alchemist who was unrivaled by any of his peers at the Academy. Dr. Reveck was a respected colleague of
Professor Cecil B. Heimerdinger
, and he loved his daughter very dearly. However, when she was still quite young, Orianna would pass away due to unknown causes, and in his attempts to save her, Reveck turned to increasingly unethical and disturbing experiments towards developing a cure. This research was ultimately discovered and cost him the respect of Piltover's scientific community, including Heimerdinger, and he was eventually dismissed from the Academy with no mention of his crime.

As a direct result of this, Reveck would leave both Piltover and Heimerdinger, moving to a new laboratory in
Zaun
.

The Reconstruction

Arcane

Dr. Reveck, who would become known as
"Singed"
during his exile, kept his daughter's body in a
chemtech
preservation pod within a secret, well-kept room, where he would sometimes go to read bedtime stories to her.

This room could only be unlocked by a key that was hidden in a locket with Orianna's portrait, which would play a haunting lullaby from a music box hidden inside. Singed would carry this key with him always, listening to the melody while looking at his daughter's portrait. He became obsessed with finding a "cure to death" to bring Orianna back, no matter the cost to himself or others.

After many long years of research and countless atrocities committed in his daughter's name, Singed finally found his "cure to death" in the form of
Warwick
, whose blood he then used to evolve
Viktor
into the herald of a new age.

After administering this cure, Orianna awoke in a new body made entirely of
hextech
. Singed presented his daughter with a number of gifts, including a music box, a flower with a ribbon, and a wooden horse. Orianna looked at none of these items, instead staring blankly at her own reflection in the mirror.

Appearance

Orianna was a sickly and pale young girl with light blue eyes, golden hair, and white freckles over her nose and cheeks. When she was younger, Orianna appeared healthier and would wear her hair up in a bun, and she owned several tutus which were kept in her room. After she was
"evolved"
by
Singed's
cure, Orianna's appearance was transformed into that of a purely mechanical ballerina. Her skin became silver, sleek, and metallic with gilded golden markings that travel across her body, with her eyes changing to a light silver. Orianna's hair remains a light gold color, but is now metallic in appearance. Her limbs are connected with bendable joints, giving her a cold and robotic, yet delicate appearance, resembling a porcelain doll or mannequin.

Personality

Orianna was a curious and altruistic young girl, and as a human, she was willing to help others even when dissuaded. As a purely mechanical being, she struggled to express her emotions, appearing somewhat cold or lifeless to the world around her.

Abilities

Golem Physiology:
Orianna is an artificial construct whose body is made completely from metal and clockwork, which was formed through a combination of
Warwick's
blood and
Viktor's
hexcore.

Evolved:
Orianna's mechanical body is a result of
hexcorization
using
Viktor's
power, but with
Singed's
modifications, giving her a unique physiology and independent thought from the Herald's control. After her augmentation, Orianna has strength, durability, and agility superior to that of a human, and she is no longer vulnerable to most human emotions or weaknesses.

Singed

Dr. Reveck was once the loving father of Orianna before she died to unknown causes. After this tragedy, the doctor kept Orianna's body preserved in a chemtech pod hidden inside a secret room in his laboratory, where he would sometimes go to read bedtime stories to her. This room could only be unlocked by a special key hidden within a locket with Orianna's portrait, which Singed carries on his person always and plays a haunting lullaby from a music box whenever it is opened.
Orianna's death heavily affected the doctor, and he became obsessed with finding a cure to death, no matter how disturbing and unethical his experiments became, abandoning his reputation and his position at Piltover Academy so that she might live again. Singed's research towards this cure led to the creation of
Warwick
, whose blood he then used to evolve
Viktor
. Singed's attempts to revive Orianna were eventually successful, and she awoke in a new
hextech
body.

Viktor

Viktor's hexcore played a key role in Orianna's reconstruction, with
Singed
extracting magical substances from the Herald's cocoon to help engineer his "cure to death." Although she was revived by his magic, Orianna was not connected to Viktor's hivemind and therefore survived after the hexcore's destruction over the Hexgate.
