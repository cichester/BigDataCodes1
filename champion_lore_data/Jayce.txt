Early Life
[

edit source
]

Jayce was born to House Talis, a family of renowned toolmakers best-known for their hammers and the collapsible pocket wrench.
[

[

]
At some point, Jayce's father passed away, leaving the Talis family hammer business to him and his mother
Ximena
.
When Jayce was young, he and his mother got caught in a snowstorm, and they were saved by a mysterious hooded mage who teleported them a safe distance away. The man left Jayce a runic crystal, and having seen the wonders of magic with his own eyes, Jayce became determined to learn how to harness magic through science so that he might share its miracle with the rest of the world: an idea he called
"hextech"
.
[

]
He eventually abandoned the family business and started research into the arcane, becoming a student at Piltover Academy. Here, his ambition and scientific brilliance quickly won him the attention of a number of influential figures, including
Professor Cecil B. Heimerdinger
, who was both head of the Council and the dean of Piltover Academy, and
Clan Kiramman
, who decided to support his studies as his patrons.

The Robbery
[

Some time after buying supplies from
Benzo's
shop in the undercity,
[

[

]
Jayce returned to his workshop just in time for him to realize that it had been broken into. As Jayce attempted to break down the door,
one
of the robbers dropped an unstable hexite crystal that Jayce had been storing in a chest, which caused an explosion that destroyed the entire face of the building. This alerted
Heimerdinger
, the authorities, and the Council to his unauthorized research, and after his materials were confiscated, Jayce was put on trial.
Despite Heimerdinger's advice to simply apologize for his error, Jayce told the Council that his research was "revolutionary" and could hold the key to harnessing magic through science. However, the Council, especially those who feared the arcane like Heimerdinger and
Bolbok
, held the opinion that magic was uncontrollable and dangerous, and Jayce was ultimately expelled from the Academy—a lenient sentence as the Ethos demanded he be banished from
Piltover
. Having brought great shame upon himself, his family, and his sponsors in
Clan Kiramman
turned their backs on Jayce, and he was resigned to the idea that he would have to join the Talis hammer business after all.

Partners in Hextech
[
edit

edit source
]


Having lost his life's work, Jayce returned to his destroyed workshop and contemplated suicide, before he was stopped by Heimerdinger's assistant,
Viktor
. Viktor had been inspired by Jayce's speech at the trial and had begun reading through the journal Jayce had written describing his
"hextech"
theory, and offered to help Jayce complete his research.
[
1
]
In the middle of the night, the two of them figured out how to stabilize the crystals, and Viktor helped sneak Jayce to Heimerdinger's lab, where all the materials for his experiment were scheduled to be destroyed.
Councilor Mel Medarda
, who had similarly been intrigued by Jayce's speech at the trial, distracted the guards for them, giving Jayce and Viktor the opportunity to complete the experiment just as they were caught by Heimerdinger.
[
7
]
Despite the professor's reluctance to support hextech, the Council eventually decided to approve Jayce's endeavor after learning it was viable, restoring his reputation and the Kirammans' support for him.
Jayce and Viktor worked together for the next few years as partners, rising to become the most revolutionary inventors in all of Piltover. Although Viktor preferred to keep to his lab work in the background, Jayce flourished in the spotlight and would regularly interact with new clients or sponsors for their research. Jayce and Viktor were responsible for creating many inventions during this time, participating in the Distinguished Innovators Competition together
[
8
]
and even creating the Hexgate, a device within a massive tower that was capable of launching airships halfway across the world. The Hexgate revolutionized trade and transportation, putting Piltover on the map as a global shipping lane. Being credited for Piltover's newfound prosperity, Jayce became an icon across the entire city and was given the moniker "the Man of Progress."

Piltovan Bicentennial

The Next Chapter
[
edit
|
edit source
]


For the celebration of Piltover's bicentennial Progress Day, Jayce was surprised to learn that he had been chosen by the Council to deliver the main speech, which was an honor usually only given to Heimerdinger. In anticipation for the big event, Jayce and
Viktor
made plans to present their newest inventions—prototypes powered by the new
hextech
gemstone—for Jayce's speech. They called this the "next chapter of hextech" and showcased the gemstone's capabilities to
Heimerdinger
, powering the
Atlas gauntlets
and the
hexclaw
, which were tools for easier labor. Though impressed, Heimerdinger advised the two that they need more time to ensure their inventions were safe enough for use. Viktor and
Mel
both urged Jayce to ignore Heimerdinger and go ahead with the presentation anyway, but Jayce ultimately took Heimerdinger's advice, disappointing them both.
After Jayce had given his speech, an
undercity terrorist
stole one of the gemstones that was planned to be showcased during the presentation. Fearing the thief might weaponize the gemstone against Piltover, Jayce suggested to the Council that they shut down all hextech operations. However, the Council had become too reliant on the Hexgate for their profits. Mel instead suggested that Jayce be instated as a Council member to better safeguard the city's hextech operations—a radical suggestion since the Council had until that point only ever held seven seats. Heimerdinger agreed with Mel's proposal, however, and when the rest of the Council followed, Jayce became the eighth councilor.
[

]

Councilor Talis
[
edit
|
edit source
]


As a councilor, Jayce worked with
Marcus
, the Sheriff of the
Piltover Enforcers
, to track down the thief of the stolen gemstone, uncovering and putting a stop to many forms of illegal trading—including those conducted by Piltovan citizens. However, other councilors took an unfavorable view of Jayce's latest security measures, as it stepped on the toes of the influential nobles and merchant clans whom the councilors relied on for support. Under Mel's guidance, Jayce would quickly adapt to the quid pro quo dynamics of politics and surprisingly became adept at gaining political allies. Later on the balcony, the Jayce and Mel confessed their feelings for one another, beginning a romantic relationship. However, while Jayce was distracted with politics, he failed to recognize Viktor's deteriorating health until he collapsed and ended up in the hospital.
[
9
]
After learning Viktor was terminally ill, Jayce became desperate to save his friend, supporting the development of his
hexcore
as a means to augment Viktor's life and potentially cure his disease. Viktor's research hit a roadblock, however, and when they tried to consult Heimerdinger, the professor immediately demanded the hexcore's destruction, stating it was too dangerous to exist. Jayce refused Heimerdinger's request, and when Heimerdinger threatened to use his political powers, Jayce convinced the other councilors to remove Heimerdinger, explaining that he was incapable of handling the recent crisis with the undercity. Around the same time, Jayce also learned that his friend
Caitlyn
, the Kirammans' daughter, had used his authority to release a prisoner named
Vi
, and he pretended that she was acting under his orders.
[
10
]
As a result of the recent attacks, Jayce would order a blockade across the Bridge of Progress, deeming it necessary for Piltover's safety. Viktor, however, had been unaware of the closure and was consulting a
friend
in the undercity about the hexcore. Jayce argued with Viktor for violating the lockdown, but Viktor reacted coldly to him after he called people from the undercity "dangerous." While examining a
chemtech weapon
built by the undercity terrorist, Mel suggested Jayce and Viktor might need to develop hextech weapons as a countermeasure, in case the undercity developed them first. Jayce was initially reluctant to support her idea, but despite Viktor's vehement opposition, Jayce eventually decided it was the only way to resolve the crisis and began to conceive a hextech weapon of his own: the
Mercury Hammer
.
[

]

Shimmer Factory Raid
[
edit
|
edit source
]

After another attack killed the Sheriff and multiple enforcers on the bridge, Jayce became traumatized by the sight, and was later compelled by Mel's mother, the
Noxian
general
Ambessa Medarda
, that developing hextech weapons was a necessary step. With Marcus dead, all of his past dealings with the undercity were uncovered from his office, and they discussed his betrayal at the next Council meeting. Here, Caitlyn and Vi returned from the undercity and exposed the mastermind behind the Sheriff's activities and the recent crisis was an undercity industrialist named
Silco
, whose ultimate goal was an independent nation of
Zaun
, and the terrorist responsible for the recent attacks was named
Jinx
. Jayce believed immediate action needed to be taken against Silco, but Mel warned him about the civilian casualties that would occur, instead advocating a diplomatic solution. The other councilors sided with Mel, and Jayce left to build his Mercury Hammer in the
3
Talis House forge
.
Since the rest of the Council was unwilling to respond, Jayce joined forces with Vi, who recruited him to her crusade and took his
Atlas gauntlets
to use as combat gloves. Together, the two of them raided one of Silco's factories, taking down the
chemtank guards
and dismantling a large amount of the crime lord's
shimmer
production. However, during the fight Jayce accidentally killed a Zaunite child in the crossfire, who happened to be the son of
Renni
, one of the
chembarons
.
[
12
]
Although Jayce believed the undercity didn't stand a chance against Piltover, he realized that war between their two cities would result in the deaths of countless innocents, and unwilling to sacrifice any more lives, he withdrew his support for Vi, leaving her to continue her fight against Silco on her own.
[

A Promise Broken
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Jayce found Viktor in a place his partner often went to ruminate, interrupting him right as he was about to walk off the ledge. After remembering their good times together, Jayce expressed his regret for having created and used a hextech weapon, believing he had to destroy his Mercury Hammer. Viktor also had regrets and made Jayce promise to destroy the hexcore, since he was unable to do so himself. To make things right, Jayce arranged a private meeting with Silco to negotiate a peace settlement after the shimmer raid. Despite Silco's lofty demands—including use of the Hexgate for trade, blanket amnesty, and Zaun's independence—Jayce agreed to his terms, on the condition that Silco discontinue his shimmer production, return the hextech gemstone, and extradite Jinx to Piltover to answer for her crimes.
[
8
]
At the blood moon Council meeting, Jayce brought Viktor with him and announced that he intended to resign from the Council, which would follow his final act: putting forth a vote to approve the peace deal with Silco. Initially, most of the Council opposed granting Zaun their independence, but with Mel's support, they managed to convince each of them, one by one, until the vote was unanimous. However, at the exact moment it seemed war had been averted, the chamber was suddenly struck by a
rocket
,
[
8
]
killing Councilors
Bolbok
,
Hoskel
, and
Kiramman
. Jayce and Mel were, miraculously, completely unharmed by the attack; but Jayce had little time to question it as he saw Viktor was on the verge of death. After rushing his mortally-wounded friend to their laboratory, Jayce read through Viktor's notes related to the hexcore and then used it to seal him in a glowing, otherworldly magical fluid, which slowly regenerated his injuries and left him in a comatose state.
As Viktor recovered, Jayce remained by his side, leaving the remaining councilors to their duties as he withdrew from politics completely. As Silco was now dead, Vi returned the Atlas gauntlets to Jayce so he might fix them, as they had been damaged during her battle against Silco's goons. Jayce initially refused, and although Mel promised to block any of the Council's efforts to weaponize hextech, Jayce's discussion with Caitlyn led him to worry about the threat Jinx posed, and he began to think Vi might be right about hextech weapons being the solution. At the memorial for the fallen councilors,
Renni
interrupted the service with another attack by her chemtank thugs, trying to avenge her son who Jayce had killed during the shimmer raid. Jayce was rescued by Vi using his
Mercury Cannon
, and Renni herself was killed by Ambessa's Noxians. After the attack, Jayce decided to repair Vi's gauntlets and built Caitlyn a new
hextech rifle
to bring with them on their mission to pursue Jinx into Zaun.
[
13
]
When Viktor eventually woke up as a fusion of man and hextech, Jayce was overjoyed, but Viktor reacted coldly to him after he realized that Jayce had used the hexcore to bring him back and had drawn up blueprints for new hextech weapons. Although Jayce wanted to go back working in their lab together, Viktor abruptly ended their partnership, claiming their paths had "diverged" as he bid Jayce goodbye and left for Zaun.

Investigating the Anomaly
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Jayce remained in his lab for some time after
Viktor
left, and was there when
Heimerdinger
and
Ekko
suddenly broke in through the maintenance tunnels. Recognizing Heimerdinger, Jayce lowered his weapon and invited them in, and the three of them discussed science. Jayce recognized the corruption patterns Heimerdinger was interested in from Viktor's
hexcore
,
[
14
]
and then explained Viktor's "wild rune" theory to Ekko and Heimerdinger, in which certain commands could trigger primal, natural reactions within the arcane. The inventors theorized that the corruption could be a symptom of to the overuse of hextech, and to investigate the cause of the corruption in Zaun, Jayce then took Heimerdinger and Ekko to the bottom of the Hexgate, where the capsules powering its use were all stored. As they stepped inside, however, the three of them were all absorbed into a massive spherical Anomaly—the source of the corruption—which scattered them across space, time, and nothingness.
[
15
]

The End of Piltover
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Jayce was separated from Ekko and Heimerdinger and landed in a dark, desolate wasteland, and was greeted by a mysterious hooded figure—the mage from his childhood—who led him from a distance. Jayce's hammer was heavier in this reality, and as he followed the mage, he found himself underneath an endless dark
storm
circling above the ruins of Piltover. As he walked, Jayce was followed by the hollowed metal corpses that littered the wastes, and he fell into a ravine, breaking his leg on his hammer. At the bottom of the pit, Jayce dismantled his useless hammer, building himself a leg brace from the metal scraps as he waited for his broken bones to heal. Jayce drew up calculations on the wall as he survived on wild animals, his mind suffering for a long, indeterminate length of time. He found himself tormented by visions of the people he had failed, like Viktor and Mel.
[
16
]
Eventually, Jayce managed to climb out of the ravine and ascended the islands of floating rubble to the top of the hexgate tower, which was located in the eye of the storm. There, Jayce encountered a cold metal corpse wielding a corrupted version of his very own Mercury Hammer, and realizing the corpse was his own, Jayce fell to his knees as the mage reappeared before him, silently. Jayce asked the mage why he would let him create hextech if it was only going to destroy everything, after which the mage revealed himself to be a future version of Viktor, who had been the one responsible for creating this bleak reality. In order to defeat his past self, Viktor traveled through many alternate realities and had deduced that in all timelines, Jayce was the only person capable of stopping him.
[
17
]
Having been given his new mission, Jayce took the corrupted Mercury Hammer and made a promise, and with that Viktor summoned a new Anomaly, sending Jayce back to his original timeline.
[
16
]

Confronting the Evolution
[
edit
|
edit source
]


When Jayce returned at the bottom of the Hexgate, he encountered
Salo
, whose legs had been magically healed by Viktor and was not acting like his usual self. Viktor then spoke to Jayce through Salo's body and tried to reconcile with Jayce, explaining that he had found the solution to heal all the world's suffering. Jayce tried to convince Viktor that hextech needed to be destroyed, and when Viktor would not listen, Jayce killed Salo with his corrupted Mercury Hammer before setting out to confront his old friend in person.
[
18
]
At the
commune
, Jayce saw hundreds of people living in idealized, emotionless harmony, their minds and bodies twisted by the hexcore towards the "perfection" Viktor sought. Horrified, Jayce tried to destroy the hollowed creatures, but they showed no fear in the face of death, instead leading him calmly towards Viktor's new home. When Jayce saw the Herald suspended in midair, with glowing threads emerging from him to puppeteer his cultists, Jayce activated his corrupted
Mercury Cannon
and blasted his friend through the chest, hoping to put an end to his madness. As Viktor lost consciousness, his cultists let out a bloodcurdling shriek to the heavens before collapsing onto the ground.
[
19
]
As Ambessa's Noxians invaded the area, Jayce made a hasty escape and found
Caitlyn
,
Vi
, and
Jinx
, and he brought them all safely back to Piltover.
[
20
]
Still tormented by visions, Jayce went to the rebuilt Council chamber and deduced that
Mel
was a
mage
and had protected him from Jinx's attack months ago, without saving the others. When she suddenly arrived in the chamber, Jayce confronted her about her earlier manipulations of him, but they were suddenly interrupted by one of the creatures Jayce had seen in the future—a sleek white metal puppet that spoke to him in Viktor's voice. Viktor informed them that Ambessa was planning an invasion of the city, and attempted to recruit Jayce to his "Glorious Evolution" so that he could access to the Anomaly without bloodshed. Jayce refused Viktor's offer, as he knew the Anomaly would destroy Piltover. The encounter quickly turned violent, and Jayce was saved by Mel, who helped him destroy Viktor's puppet. After the attack, Jayce called a gathering in the Council chamber and presented the broken puppet to the people of both Piltover and Zaun, enacting a call-to-arms to defend the Hexgate and evacuating anyone who did not wish to be present during the invasion.
[

Battle at the Hexgate
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Because he had seen Piltover's future, Jayce knew that their defense was destined to fail. Still, he was determined to defy fate as he strategized with Caitlyn, Vi, and Mel in the makeshift Council room in the bunker. As Caitlyn and the Enforcers tried to destroy Viktor's sphere, Jayce would deactivate the Hexgate to prevent Viktor from stealing the Anomaly. As Jayce was removing the hextech power cells, however, Viktor broke in through the door using his
hexclaw
, having transformed into his new, fully-evolved form. The former friends spoke to each other, but Viktor would not listen to Jayce's pleas to the remnants of his humanity. With a wave of his third arm, he reversed all of Jayce's efforts, reactivating the Hexgate and taking the Anomaly with him on his ascent up the tower shaft. Jayce found himself suspended in
gravity
, and he pursued Viktor to the tower roof, ultimately failing to stop him.
[
17
]
At the top, Viktor unleashed the Anomaly into the sky and summoned a massive
arcane storm
, which encircled the city and threatened to absorb everyone into his hivemind. Jayce closed his eyes as he too was absorbed into the arcane dreamscape where Viktor's consciousness dwelled with all the rest. Here, Viktor explained his desire to eliminate all imperfections and suffering from the world, but Jayce disagreed with Viktor, stating that imperfections were what made the world beautiful. Just as it seemed Jayce was to be subsumed into the hexcore,
Ekko
managed to use his
Z-Drive
to subdue Viktor, finally giving Jayce the opportunity he needed to get through to his old friend.
Jayce showed Viktor a vision of the bleak future he had seen, where everything had gone according to Viktor's plan. He also showed him his conversation with Viktor's future self as the old mage explained his regrets. Temporarily free of the control that the hexcore had over him, Viktor agreed to destroy the hexcore and all his puppets, and Jayce handed him the runic crystal on his wrist, remaining by his side. As the hexcore and the puppets of the Glorious Evolution were all subsumed into the acceleration rune, Jayce and Viktor vanished too, dissolving into nothingness as Jayce fulfilled his final promise to his friend.

Legacy
[
edit
|
edit source
]

After the battle, Jayce's corrupted
Mercury Hammer
would crumble into dust at the top of the Hexgate, and a
demonic raven
would arrive to scavenge its remains. Jayce was mourned by his
mother
at the funeral, and presumably the rest of
Piltover
for his sacrifice.
[
17
]

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Jayce was a tall, muscular, and tanned man with hazel eyes and styled dark brown hair. Jayce was often seen wearing typical
Piltovan
clothing that consisted of a white suit with red pants and a red tie, a black undershirt, and a white tailcoat with red pauldrons on his shoulders, which was a more elegant and expensive outfit while attending formal events or to matters related to his Council work. In his
laboratory
, Jayce would often sport a white button up lab coat with silver buttons and brown leather shoulder pauldrons trimmed with gold, as well as brown gloves, trousers, and boots. When in battle, Jayce would wield a giant hammer made from golden plating as a weapon. On his wrist, Jayce always wore a leather bracelet with with a blue runic crystal, which had been given to him by the
mage
who had saved him as a child.
After Jayce's trip through the Anomaly, his appearance became noticeably more
haggard
, growing shaggy facial hair and his runic crystal becoming fused to his skin. His usual suit became dirty and tattered, and he would start wearing a large leather strap over his left shoulder and a metal leg brace fashioned from his broken hammer. Corruption would begin to spread on his arm, which would become worse over time. After returning to his own timeline and taking command of Piltovan forces, Jayce would replace his ruined clothes with a new, darker tailcoat, with black, gold, and red armor over his chest and shoulders.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

As an inventor dedicated to improving the lives and welfare of his people, Jayce was a charismatic, idealistic, and visionary man of science. While he was known to be slightly egotistical, Jayce often struggled to live up to the lofty image he crafted for himself, repeatedly pushing the boundaries of progress without considering the cost. Jayce was characterized by his confidence, determination, and optimism, but he was also naive to the malefactors who could misuse
hextech
, which he had intended to uplift and empower the people of
Piltover
. Once he realized his invention could be used to inflict suffering, Jayce found himself overwhelmed by the consequences, and since he felt responsible for his discovery, he bravely and selflessly tried to shut the enterprise down, and he put his own life in danger many times to protect his city.
As a result of his inexperience, Jayce felt forced to compromise his ideals for the sake of pragmatism, even having to conform to the corruption of politics when the other councilors began to plot against him. He would betray his longtime mentor
Heimerdinger
, who continued to obstruct research that could save
Viktor's
life. Jayce's failure to find immediate solutions fueled his doubts and caused him to make rash rectifications; even to the point of entering an imprudent conflict with
Silco
. Ultimately, once he realized his thoughtless actions could endanger innocent
Zaunites
, Jayce pulled back on reckless conflict and returned to his ideals of trying to do good for all. He was not afraid to go against the Council's wishes and brokered a peace with Silco without consulting them first, believing without a doubt that this was the right decision. The failure of this deal nearly lost him Viktor, after which Jayce blamed himself and withdrew from politics completely.
After Jayce traveled to an apocalyptic future, the horrors he had witnessed haunted and traumatized him. He became much more agitated and paranoid than he was before, as his only goal became to prevent what he had seen from coming to fruition. Jayce gradually recovered from his experience in the Anomaly as he reconnected with
Caitlyn
,
Mel
, and his other allies at home, and he used his determination as a means to rally the people of Piltover and Zaun against their annihilation. When he confronted Viktor again, he decided not to kill him but to instead reach out to his humanity, and remained there so he wouldn't be alone in his final moments.

Abilities
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Inventor:
A brilliant mind, Jayce had a long list of achievements in the field of
hextech
and engineering, especially those made to utilize hextech gemstones. As one of the foremost inventors of hextech, Jayce was a leading scientist in Piltovan innovation, with his crowning achievement being the construction of the Hexgate, which were a massive structure in the city's center that could launch airships halfway across the world. Though a majority of Jayce's hextech inventions were intended as tools for easier labor (such as the
Atlas gauntlets
), Jayce would later build devices designed specifically for combat, like
Caitlyn's
sniper rifle
.
Mercury Hammer
/
Mercury Cannon
:
Jayce's personal hextech weapon, which was built in order to defend Piltover from a possible war with Zaun. Jayce first used his hammer in a raid on
Silco's
shimmer
factory. It can transform into a powered greathammer with heavy, intensified blows to be used for melee combat—or it can transform into a cannon that can shoot orbs of pure hextech energy. It can also emit an
electrical field
that surrounds Jayce and knocks back and electrocutes nearby enemies. After traveling to an apocalyptic future, Jayce would eventually replace his hammer with a
Corrupted Mercury Hammer
, which was powered by a small wild rune instead of a hextech gemstone.
Acceleration Gate
:
The Talis Acceleration Gate is a large mechanical device operated from a chair with levers. The energy field is capable of aiming and launching any object at a remarkable speed. Jayce gave an acceleration gate to the
Piltover Enforcers
to help defend the Hexgate, and it was used to launch giant shipping containers at
Ambessa's
forces and
Viktor's
cocoon.
[
17
]
Diplomacy:
While not as skilled as
Mel Medarda
in politics, Jayce's direct actions would lead to many technological innovations, and his charisma and oratory skills made him a celebrity and icon across all of Piltover. Jayce was also able to negotiate many deals with Piltover's elite and politicians to support his agendas, and personally brokered a temporary peace between Piltover and Zaun. Later, he would give a speech to rally the people of Piltover and Zaun against
Ambessa's
invasion, which while not convincing everyone, managed to sway some of the Jinxers to Piltover's side.
Physical Strength:
Years of undertaking physically demanding work in his forge molded Jayce's body towards an athletic physique. He appeared to be very strong and has developed enormous stamina and fast reflexes. He was also a proven fighter when he defended himself from chemtank guards and defeated them in combat with his Mercury Hammer.
Visions:
After his encounter with the
mysterious hooded figure
in the apocalyptic future, the mage's will would work within Jayce, and he would receive violent distorted visions warning him whenever one of
Viktor's
evolved soldiers were nearby. The visions alerted him about
Salo's
transformation, as well as the presence of the puppet made from the body of
Huck
in the rebuilt Council chamber.

Relations

Viktor
[
edit
|
edit source
]


After the explosion in Jayce's workshop, Viktor was sent by
Heimerdinger
to collect any hazardous materials from the site. Viktor asked many questions about Jayce's research, and Jayce seemed to be hostile to Viktor, perceiving him as nothing more than a judgemental Academy representative come to put an end to his research. However, Viktor surprised Jayce by being the only person to believe in his life's work, at a time when his mentor, his sponsors, and even his own mother did not. After Viktor offered a solution to help Jayce stabilize the
hextech
crystals, Jayce named Viktor his partner in hextech, and they broke into Heimerdinger's lab to prove Jayce's theory. The experiment was ultimately successful, and the new inventors managed to revolutionize
Piltover
with their new technology.
[
7
]
Jayce and Viktor's partnership grew into a true friendship, and they became as close as brothers in the years they worked together. However, Viktor would sometimes be left behind by Jayce, who became famous as the public face of their inventions, as despite Jayce's requests for Viktor to join him onstage, Viktor did not like the attention. Their bond would be tested when Jayce was given a seat on the Council, which would prevent him from working in the lab with Viktor.
[
9
]
Jayce and Viktor began to get into arguments about Heimerdinger's guidance and Jayce's Council work, as well as the prejudices he developed against the undercity as a result of
Jinx's
bombings.
[
11
]
Viktor, driven by principle, would flat-out refuse to build hextech weapons to defend Piltover, while Jayce was more willing to resort to drastic measures to protect his people. They began to keep secrets from one another, and in Jayce's case, he would engage in an undercity raid he knew Viktor would not approve of. Ultimately, Jayce and Viktor both lost themselves, and the two lamented their shared failure together. Together, they tried to end the crisis by granting Zaun their independence from Piltover, but this was prevented by forces beyond their control.
Despite their diverging paths, Jayce was always willing to come back to Viktor when his life was threatened. When he learned Viktor was terminally ill, Jayce dropped everything to help him find a cure and was even willing to betray his mentor, Heimerdinger, when Viktor's experiment was threatened.
[
10
]
Viktor, however, valued his principles over his own life, and was disappointed with Jayce, when in his desperation to save his best friend he broke his promise to destroy the hexcore. Jayce's failure to destroy the hexcore caused Viktor to abruptly end their partnership, despite Jayce's pleas for things to go back to the way they were.
[
14
]
When Jayce and Viktor met again, they had become enemies, as Jayce had just witnessed the apocalyptic future Viktor would create.
[
16
]
To prevent this, Jayce attempted to kill Viktor in his commune, driven forth by violent visions that tormented his mind.
[
19
]
Despite their hostility, Viktor always remained cordial with Jayce, requesting moments of "civility" and informing Jayce that he was "pleased" to see him. Jayce claimed that his partner had "died" in Jinx's attack, but still held onto hope that Viktor was still in there. Jayce's belief in Viktor eventually paid off and the two were able to reconcile, after Viktor realized he would be lonely in his perfect future with no problems left to solve. Viktor attempted to spare Jayce as he sacrificed himself to end the Glorious Evolution, but Jayce remained by his side, and they both vanished together into Jayce's acceleration rune.
[

Ximena Talis
[

As Jayce's mother, Ximena always tried to support Jayce's wellbeing in any way she could. When he was young, the two of them got caught in a snowstorm together, and in her efforts to get Jayce to safety she eventually collapsed in the snow. Years later, when Jayce was put on trial for his illegal research into the arcane, Ximena pled with the Council to prevent his banishment. However, in her efforts to protect him she condemned Jayce's research and claimed he was "not in his right mind," which insulted Jayce, and she later argued that Jayce shouldn't value his dream over his own life. After this argument, Jayce believed his own mother had turned her back on him before he left her to go speak with
Caitlyn
.

After Jayce had proven his experiment viable, Jayce and his mother reconciled and remaining close in the following years. Ximena was very proud of everything her son had accomplished and he would sometimes return home to speak with her in moments of great stress. After the battle at the Hexgate, Ximena was present at the funeral, presumably mourn her son's passing.

Cecil B. Heimerdinger

Jayce held Heimerdinger in high regard and considered him a mentor. Heimerdinger often feared that magic could be too dangerous an enterprise at times but Jayce believed that he would eventually prove to him that
hextech
could be a worthy, beneficial endeavor once proven safe. For the most part, Jayce heeded Heimerdinger's advice and wisdom; such as when he withheld hextech inventions from being made public at the bicentennial Progress Day because Heimerdinger said it needed more safeguards. But Jayce also believed that Heimerdinger could be out of touch, like when he tried to destroy the hexcore even though
Viktor's
life depended on the project's success. Although he did so regrettably, Jayce was willing to convince the Piltover Council to vote Heimerdinger out as a member, under the explanation that he was incapable of resolving the crisis with the undercity.
[

]
Despite this development, and the fact that Heimerdinger had left
Piltover
to stay with the
Firelights
in
Zaun
, the two inventors remained on good terms, with Jayce feeling guilty for betraying his mentor and Heimerdinger seeming to regret forsaking his former students when they needed him.

[

When Jayce caught Heimerdinger and
Ekko
breaking into his laboratory, he welcomed them inside and made them tea as they discussed science. The three of them would then be separated again while investigating the Anomaly. Though Jayce and Heimerdinger would not meet again after this, they presumably remembered each other fondly.

Clan Kiramman
[

]

When Jayce was a student at the Academy, he caught the eye of
Cassandra
and
Tobias Kiramman
, who recognized his ambition and decided to financially support his research. Cassandra considered him one of the clan's protégés, and after the robbery destroyed his lab, she vowed to speak up for him at the trial. Cassandra voted to prevent his banishment from
Piltover
; however, the trial still ended with his expulsion from the Academy and his disgrace in the eyes of Piltovan society, bringing great shame upon both House Talis and Clan Kiramman. The Kirammans withdrew their support for Jayce and forbid him from visiting them anymore, but Jayce managed to prove everyone wrong when he successfully completed his
hextech
experiment. Cassandra and the rest of the Council would eventually approve hextech research, redeeming Jayce in the eyes of Piltover and restoring the Kiramman Clan's support for him. After Cassandra's death, Jayce was present at the memorial service for her, and
Renni
would taunt him for "losing a loved one." After Renni's attack, Caitlyn rose as the new head of Clan Kiramman and Jayce continued to work closely with her, building hextech weapons to support her strike team into
Zaun
.

Caitlyn Kiramman
[
edit
|
edit source
]

As a young protégé sponsored by
Clan Kiramman
, Jayce would often interact with the clan's heiress, Caitlyn. During their childhood days they became close friends, with Jayce seeing her as a younger sister that he regaled with stories of his adventures and grand ambitions. After Jayce's expulsion from Piltover Academy, the Kiramman Clan believed Jayce had brought shame upon them and forbid Caitlyn from seeing him anymore. Both Caitlyn and Jayce were deeply upset by this, with Jayce even contemplating suicide after he lost the only person still willing to support him.
[

]
After Jayce regained the Kirammans' support, he was allowed to be friends with Caitlyn again. He became a celebrated inventor across all of Piltover, and she joined the
Piltover Enforcers
as a junior officer. Caitlyn was often assigned menial tasks during this time, so Jayce would try to distract and tease her while she was still on-duty. After Caitlyn was caught in an explosion, he tried to recruit her onto his security staff, which was a poorly-concealed attempt to protect her. Caitlyn refused Jayce's offer and was seemingly hurt that Jayce was not being supportive of her investigation.
[

]
Caitlyn would later forge an order from Jayce to have
Vi
released from prison, and Jayce would cover for her by pretending he was aware of it.
When Caitlyn and Vi informed the Council of
Silco's
conspiracy, Jayce was the first to demand immediate action, but Caitlyn seemed to realize Jayce was not acting himself, as he had become more militant towards the undercity as the stress of his new position took a toll on his ideals.
[
12
]
When Jayce and Caitlyn met again, it was after her
mother
had been killed in
Jinx's
attack, and he was able to find Caitlyn in the courtyard by asking her father where she was. Jayce comforted Caitlyn, and when she decided to lead her strike team into Zaun, Jayce built her a new
hextech rifle
to take with her, showing a newfound trust in her capabilities.
[
13
]
Months later, after Jayce had suffered in an apocalyptic future, he did not react aggressively towards Caitlyn and moved to get her safely back to Piltover,
[
20
]
where they planned their defense against
Ambessa's
forces. Caitlyn presumably mourned Jayce after the battle, where he would sacrifice himself to destroy the hexcore and save the entire city.

Mel Medarda
[

edit source
]

Along with
Viktor
, Mel was an early supporter of Jayce's
hextech
research, first voting to prevent his banishment from Piltover and then helping the rogue inventor complete his experiment in
Heimerdinger's
lab by distracting the guards. Heimerdinger arrived too late to stop Jayce and Viktor's experiment, and Mel declared it the beginning of "the era of magic."
[
7
]
Years later, when Jayce was popularizing hextech in Piltover, Jayce sought out Mel's guidance on a number of issues. She aided Jayce in bypassing the red tape obstructing his agenda, advised him how to maneuver in politics, and she even convinced the Piltover Council to elevate Jayce to a councilor himself. Eventually, Mel became Jayce's confidante and they shared a number of personal and professional issues with one another, which developed into a romantic relationship. Jayce held Mel in high regard and felt nothing was impossible with Mel by his side, so he would often turn to her for comfort in times of stress. She helped Jayce to expand his influence over Piltover, even supporting his motion to oust Heimerdinger from the Council.
[
10
]
Although Jayce initially felt war with Zaun was inevitable, Mel's advice during the meeting convinced him to seek out a diplomatic solution with
Silco
, and she would be the first to support the measure.
[
8
]
After
Jinx's
attack, Mel instinctively moved to shield Jayce, sparing him from the rocket's blast with her latent abilities as a mage.
[
13
]
After Jayce's experience in the alternate universe, he confronted Mel over her past manipulations of him for hextech. Although this led to an argument, the two of them reconciled after saving each other from one of Viktor's puppets. Jayce, believing Mel was strong, declared that she would never be a "passenger" in her own life,
[
20
]
and they later planned and fought at the defense of the Hexgate. Mel presumably mourned Jayce after the battle before she left Piltover for
Noxus
.

Ambessa Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Jayce met the
Noxian
warlord in a bathhouse, when she summoned him to provide what she deemed necessary counsel with regards to the recent undercity threat. Their meeting was brief but tense, as Ambessa explained military history and blamed the Piltover Council for letting the situation spiral out of control. Jayce rebuffed Ambessa, believing
Piltover
didn't need to solve their problems the Noxian way. Still, Ambessa's words stuck with Jayce, pushing him to to react impulsively when he learned about
Silco's
conspiracy at the next Council meeting, building a hextech weapon and raiding one of Silco's factories. After realizing the cost of war, Jayce would eventually reject Ambessa's advice and seek out peace with Zaun, but the situation eventually spiraled beyond his control with
Jinx's
attack. After this, Jayce withdrew from politics and Ambessa eventually instated martial law in his absence.
When Jayce returned from the alternate future, he considered Ambessa an enemy and helped plan the defense of the Hexgate against her alliance with
Viktor
.

Vi
[
edit
|
edit source
]

While originally glancing her from his workshop trying to steal his possessions, Jayce would truly meet Vi during a Council meeting, where
Caitlyn
would bring Vi to testify in front of other councilors what they have to do in order to deal with
Silco
, berating them to take serious action against his operations. Jayce would agree with her measures despite other councilors' objections. This would ultimately lead Vi to approach Jayce privately in his forge while he was creating his
Mercury Hammer
. She would offer him a chance to storm Silco's
shimmer
factory. During that discussion she would take the
Atlas gauntlets
, which would eventually become her signature weapons.
During the attack Jayce and Vi would battle side-by-side, taking out shimmer enhanced goons. During the battle, a child got caught in Jayce's crossfire and plummeted to his death next to the shimmer forge. Jayce was devastated by this, but Vi told him that death was a daily occurance down in Zaun and that topsiders were oblivious to it, ignored it, and theat they directly caused it by allowing the situation to fester. Jayce, however, refused to continue his war against Silco and withdrew his support. Vi refused to give up the gauntlets, and Jayce was unwilling to fight her for them, leaving her to continue her fight, but he cautioned her that she wouldn't make it alone.
[
8
]
Despite parting on bad terms, Vi and Jayce maintained a mutual connection through Caitlyn, and she would eventually return the destroyed Atlas gauntlets in hopes that Jayce would repair them. Due to his promise to
Viktor
, Jayce was originally unwilling to fix the gauntlets or develop more hextech weapons. However,
Renni's
attack at the memorial changed his mind, and he and Vi would fight Renni and her thugs once again side-by-side using Jayce's
hammer
. After this, Jayce would not only repair and return the gauntlets to Vi, but build a new
hextech rifle
for Caitlyn so that they would both be equipped for their journey into the undercity.
[
13
]
Jayce and Vi remained allies after that point, as he helped Caitlyn and
Jinx
get Vi to safety in Piltover. Vi was also present to help Jayce and the others plan the defense of the Hexgate against
Ambessa's
invasion.

Silco
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Jayce hated Silco ever since he discovered he was responsible for the escalating tensions between
Piltover
and
Zaun
, and would react violently to the revelation by leading a raid with
Vi
against one of the crime lord's
shimmer
factories. Silco, in turn, did not seem to think highly of Jayce, seeing him as a young and inexperienced leader who had "tipped his hand" when he eventually offered peace. Silco delivered excessive demands to Jayce during their negotiation, including free trade routes, unrestricted access to the Hexgate, blanket amnesty, and sovereignty for Zaun. These demands displeased Jayce, but Silco knew he would capitulate to them when he asked to parley, which showed Silco that Jayce didn't have the determination to follow through with future military attacks. Jayce, in turn, warned Silco that no one on the Piltover Council would have offered this deal aside from him, as many in Piltover would prefer the undercity be simply slaughtered by Piltover's technologically superior military force.
Jayce ultimately agreed to Silco's demands. However, he stipulated that Silco must end all shimmer production, return the stolen gemstone, and also hand over
Jinx
to Piltover to answer for her crimes. Silco argued that Jinx was acting on his orders and therefore he was responsible for the attacks, and while Jayce agreed, he was unable to arrest Silco, as the deal required he be placed in charge of Zaun to control his
chembaron
lieutenants. Unbeknownst to Jayce, the treaty was doomed to fall through because of this provision, as it would cause Jinx herself to kidnap Silco and eventually kill half the Council, destroying any chance at peace.
[
8
]
After Jinx's
terrorist attack
, Jayce presumably learned about Silco's death at her hands. He would later support
Caitlyn
and Vi's mission to wipe out the remnants of Silco's empire by providing them
hextech
weapons
.

Jinx
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Jayce was aware of Jinx's existence as a threat to
Piltover
, but although her attacks repeatedly caused Jayce increased stress and misfortune, the two of them never properly met face-to-face. Jinx destroyed Jayce's workshop when she was a child, and years later she bombed the Academy Square, stole his
hextech
gemstone and notes, killed the
enforcers
on the Bridge of Progress, and blew up the Council chamber, killing three councilors and nearly killing
Viktor
in the process. As part of the terms for his peace deal, Jayce believed Jinx needed to be arrested to answer for her crimes, and had developed his
Mercury Hammer
as a direct response to Jinx's own weapons development. His proposal to grant
Zaun
their independence failed as a direct result of Jinx's actions, and he later provided weapons to aid in
Caitlyn's
mission to pursue and eliminate her.
Jayce and Jinx both helped get
Vi
to safety after the destruction of Viktor's commune. It is unknown if they conversed during this time, but Jayce would eventually get his wish for Jinx to be arrested, as she immediately handed herself in to the authorities once Vi was safe.
[
20
]
Jayce and Jinx later crossed paths again in the Hexgate, but were preoccupied by their respective battles against Viktor and
Warwick
, and thus were likely unaware of the other's presence.

Ekko
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Jayce first met the young Ekko in
Benzo's
shop, where he asked for a large quantity of expensive items to use for his
hextech
experiment. Jayce then brought the items back to his workshop in Piltover, and unbeknownst to him, Ekko would follow him and later gave
Vi
the tip for her robbery. An entire face of the building would be destroyed as a result, exposing Jayce's unauthorized research to the authorities..
[
6
]
Jayce did not seem to recognize Ekko when they met again years later, and although they were both inventors and students of
Heimerdinger
, Ekko did not seem to respect Jayce, which was in part due to his role as Piltover's poster boy and prestigious lifestyle.
[
21
]
. Ekko became visibly irritated by Jayce's explanation of "wild runes," which involved him repeatedly passing tomes to Jayce until he eventually made an annoyed grunt. When Jayce showed Ekko to the bottom of the Hexgate, Ekko angrily accused Jayce of polluting the Zaunite water supply and poisoning the Firelight tree. Jayce seemed bewildered by Ekko's accusations against him, but their argument was cut short when they were all sucked into the Anomaly.
[
15
]
Despite their initial rivalry, Jayce and Ekko worked together to take down
Viktor
, using their combined efforts to save the entire city.
[
17
]
Jayce and Ekko are often allies against larger threats, but they are also rivals who disagree on issues regarding Piltover and
Zaun
. Even as fellow inventors, Ekko
