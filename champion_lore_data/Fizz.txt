Early life

In ages past, the oceans of Runeterra were home to civilizations far older than those of the land. In the depths of what is now the
Guardian’s Sea
, a great city once stood—it was here that the yordle Fizz made his home. He lived alongside the artisans and warriors of that proud, noble race. Even though he was not one of them, they treated him as an equal, and his playful nature and tall tales of adventures in the open sea made him welcome at any gathering.
But the world was changing. The oceans were growing warmer, emboldening fierce predators to rise up from the deepest trenches. Other settlements had fallen silent, but the rulers of the great city could still not agree on how to deal with the threat. Fizz pledged to roam the seas in search of survivors, or anyone who knew what had happened.
Then, one dark day, the
gigalodons
came.
These huge dragon-sharks stunned their prey with fell shrieking, and the avenues of the great city were soon clouded red. Thousands died in a matter of hours, the immense bulk of their killers crushing towers and temples in a monstrous feeding frenzy. Scenting blood in the water, Fizz raced back, determined to join the fight and save the city.
He was too late. There was nothing left of the city to save. When the debris finally settled, not a single living creature remained, nor any stone upon another, and the ravenous shoal had moved on. Alone in the cold depths, Fizz sank into mournful despair. As his yordle magic began to fade, he let himself be carried by the currents, drifting in a catatonic torpor, dreaming away the millennia…
It was only chance that reawakened him. A handful of copper coins fell from above, scattered to the seabed in the wake of a huge,
wooden
fish that swam upon the surface. This was no gigalodon, but Fizz was alarmed nonetheless—he knew little of the world overhead, but surely no fish could survive up there? He ventured up and peered into the salty air for the first time.
There were people, people who lived outside of the water and sailed in wooden fish of all sizes. Fizz found the thought both frightening and exciting, but the curious gifts they cast into the water made it clear that they wanted to be his friends. In time, following their movements to and fro across the oceans, he came to the port city of Bilgewater.

Becoming a Legend

To the inhabitants of that lawless place, this strange and slippery creature quickly became something of a legend—the Tidal Trickster, a spirit of the ocean itself. It is said that he can summon great beasts to do his bidding, hole a ship’s hull with his stone trident, and breathe air or water as it suits him. Many a misbehaving child has been warned on a moonless night: “Go quickly to sleep, or the Trickster will come and feed you to the fishes…”

Appearance
[

Unlike many of his Yordle brethren, Fizz's appearance lacks any fur. Instead, he exhibits more
amphibian
characteristics, with tentacles resembling
dreadlocks
growing out of his head. Gills on the side of his torso allow him to breathe underwater, and he possesses wider arms and legs than other Yordles, featuring 3-digit hands and feet with webbing that allows for faster movement underwater. His light blue skin transitions into darker hues towards his lower body, adorned with white spots, notably on his stomach.
While Fizz's distinctive appearance is likely a result of his environment, it remains unclear why there aren't more Yordles who share his likeness. Notably, as the oldest known Yordle, predating even
Gnar
, Fizz maintains a form reminiscent of a "pre-continental" era, which diverges from the more common furry appearance observed in his Yordle peers.

Personality
[

In the beginning, Fizz was a proud and headstrong warrior of a ancient aquatic civilization. Like most Yordles, Fizz was greatly attached to his civilization of choice, and dedicated his life to protect it, training to become a powerful warrior against terrible foes.
When that aquatic civilization was destroyed anyway, the trauma made Fizz sank in a despair so big that he hibernated, were he remained for centuries.
After waking up from his coma in Bilgewater. Fizz personality changed greatly. He became the trickster of Bilgewater, a strange and mercurial creature of the seas. Thought generally good natured, Fizz pranks often lead to chaos and destruction, such as the sinking of ships and massive amounts of casualties. In spite of this, Fizz often tends to help the good natured and punish those that try to abuse the oceans.
