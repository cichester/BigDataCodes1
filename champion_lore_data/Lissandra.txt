Early life
[

edit source
]

Lissandra came into existence millennia ago, a time when the barriers between the tangible, physical world and
other
realms
were hotly contested and
beings of old magic
roamed freely.
In this chaotic epoch, Lissandra and her sisters, Avarosa and Serylda, sought to conquer whatever they could. Lissandra tried to control the mortal world, only to be attacked by the claws of
Volibear
, rendering her sightless.

War of the Three Sisters
[

Deprived of her sight, Lissandra walked in dreams instead. Using her magic, she established a connection with powerful extradimensional entities known as the
Watchers
. On behalf of herself and her sisters, she made a deal with them to prepare Runeterra for the impending arrival of the Void.
In exchange, Lissandra and her sisters would be granted near-immortality and the ability to withstand the worst of the numbing frost. Named
Iceborn
, they were promised to be spared until the very end. Lissandra herself became the Watchers' Seeker, mediating their will to the Iceborn.
However, Avarosa and Serylda grew weary of their subservient role and sought to free themselves from their constraints. Caught in the middle, Lissandra tried to soothe her sisters' concerns while appealing to the Watchers for more time, but the Watchers became increasingly impatient. At some point, Avarosa and Serylda beseeched the demi-god
Ornn
to construct an expansive
chasm and bridge
, where they would then lock away the Watchers.
The sisters' conflicts had escalated into a full-scale war. As the war drew to an end, Avarosa and Serylda led their armies up into the mountains to face Lissandra. Despite Lissandra's efforts to remind them of the conquests achieved through their allegiance to the Watchers, her sisters remained indifferent.
At last, the Watchers had arrived in Runeterra. Drawing upon all ancient magic, Lissandra sacrificed her sisters and their amassed armies, before sealing the Watchers underneath a barrier of magical ice at the depths of the Howling Abyss.

Founding of the Frostguard
[

]

Over the passing years, Lissandra slowly realized that the barrier containing the Watchers was insufficient. The monstrous beings she had entombed were merely slumbering, gradually corrupting the True Ice around them into a more sinister essence. Now, they roamed through Lissandra's dreams as easily as she had theirs, and always she would wake, terrified, professing her loyalty to the chilling eternity they promised.
Lissandra rallied her remaining devotees to venerate her departed sisters. Their objective: accumulate as much True Ice as possible to prolong the delay of the Watchers' return, scouring the frozen expanses to enlist those of Iceborn lineage who would join their cause.
Lissandra and the first of her Frostguard exhausted all means to rewrite the history of the Freljord, erasing all records of the true events. Yet, whispers of rumors and prophetic tales endured in folklore and songs, foretelling the return of Avarosa and Serylda. Lissandra would kill silently anyone who had been claimed their reincarnations.

The Dream Thief
[

]

In one instance, Lissandra senses a Watcher trying to wake up. Laying down on the Howlling Abyss, naked, she uses her psychic powers to feed the Watcher dreams of others. She traverses the entire Freljord in astral form looking checking on other's dreams and even remarks on a young girl who appears to be iceborn.
In the final moments of the ritual, Lissandra enters the Watcher own dream, where she sees herself being devoured by them. She awakens horrified and spilling bile out of her mouth. But the Watcher is finally sleeping again. For her, this is a small price to pay for to keep them at bay.

The Hero of the Frost Moon
[

On a night of frost moon, Lissandra walked through a sacred sanctum of hears, where she visited numerous ice coffins holding half-dead frozen people whom she uses to feed the Watchers. She visited their dreams as she passed between them.
She remarked two sisters who were frozen together and who were seemingly devoted to each other. She thought their devotion is foolish and mentioned she found it more convenient to lose her sisters.

Story Hunting
[

]

In recent events, Lissandra commanded the story hunters to attack the Notai tribe, for they may harbor ancient history through their culture of retelling myths and legends. They found
Nunu
and other Notai children and took them to the
Foundling Village
. There, he met Lissandra personally, who asked him countless questions about his motherâ€™s stories, always seeking information about one
particular
song.
Lissandra also told him about one fierce monster that killed all who sought its power, thwarting the Frostguard who were sent each year, never to return. Actually, she was trying to discover the location of the Svellsongur artifact
.

Song of Nunu

Lissandra searches for a relic called the Heart of Blue, a weapon capable of creating pure ice, which she needs to keep the void at bay from Runeterra.

Appearance

edit source
]

Lissandra is a towering blue pale-skinned woman with a semblance of a sculpture. She wears a gown that looks like is made of stone or ice. She wears her signature horned headpiece and is always being followed by a trail of
Dark Ice
. Her bluish silver hair is braided into a single pigtail that goes down to her waist. Without her helmet, Lissandra can be seen to have a majestic and expressionless face, with open eyelids showing her blind eyes.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Lissandra is a very imposing presence. She ports herself like a glorious monolith, always standing above everyone else. Lissandra is very manipulative, frigid, demanding, a perfectionist, and will do anything to achieve her goals. She is a very harsh leader and does not cope well with defeat or failure. She is also a very patient person, observing the Howling Abyss for almost ten millennia, waiting for the beings below to wake up.
Although she has this icy facade, Lissandra is a fearful person. She is in constant dread that her past will catch up to her and perpetually carries a heavy burden. She came to accept that she will find no peace in this life.
