Settrigh, or Sett as he would be known, was born in
Navori
,
Ionia
to a vastayan mother and human father out of wedlock, being a crossbreed of the two races. Due to his hybrid blood and being a bastard child, Sett was an outcast among his peers and his parents were ostracized by their respective races. Those who bullied Sett were intimidated by his father's reputation as a pit fighter in
Noxus
, but when his father went missing, the bullies spared Sett no mercy. He was constantly beaten up and insulted, being called the "Beast-Boy Bastard". Eventually, Sett had enough of the bullying and began to fight back by punching them into submission. His fights became so notorious that the news reached his mother, who warned him not to go to the pits where his father had fought.
One night, Sett snuck to a local pit while his mother was asleep, and witnessed the battles conducted between numerous fighters as Noxian soldiers in the audience cheered with bloodlust. At the end of the event, Sett asked the staff if they knew his father, and they told him that he had left to fight in pits across other parts of Runeterra to seek greater fortune.

Sett loves his mother more than anything and dedicates all of his goals to supporting her and making her proud of him, to repay her for raising him in the past. He gives her gifts and money that he earned from his illegal activities while lying to keep them secret from her, though he feels guilty for doing so. Even while away from her, Sett tends to display affection towards his mother in private, and gets angered when someone makes fun of her.

Sett barely knew his father due to him leaving the family when he was still a child, so he was curious to meet him. When he found out that his father had abandoned his family to seek fortune in other parts of the world, he grew to hate his father and aspired to fight against him one day.
Though not confirmed,
8
The Old Timer
is implied to be Sett's father, due to having a personal rivalry towards Sett and knowing many details about his past.
