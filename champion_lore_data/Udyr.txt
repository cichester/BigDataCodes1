Early life

Udyr was born under a blood-red moon in the
Freljord
. At a young age, he had a deep connection to spiritual magic, greater than any spirit walker in history. However, his powers proved to be a curse to the young boy. Unlike other spirit walkers, Udyr was connected to every spirit, hearing their every need and want. Bombarded by their chaotic thoughts, Udyr's parents sought to find a spirit walker to help him master his powers, but each one told them: spirit walker training was focused on opening oneself up, not closing oneself off. One evening, his tribe would be attacked by the Frostguard, minions of the
Ice Witch
. As they slaughtered his tribemen, Udyr became overwhelmed by grief and anger. For the first time, he tapped into his powers with purpose and unleashed an avalanche that buried the marauders. In the aftermath, Udyr would spend the next several years wandering alone, doing what needed to be done to survive.
On one fateful day, Udyr aided a Winter's Claw hunting party in battling a troublesome wildclaw. Impressed by his power, they brought him back to their warmother, Hejian, who sought to train him alongside her daughter,
Kalkia
. The two would grow close, with Udyr showing her how to survive in the wild and Kalkia showing him how to live amongst men. When a pack of diseased rimefang wolves attacked the Winter's Claw, Udyr was affected by their madness, becoming lost to their hunger. He blindly attacked the tribe, nearly killing a child, before being restrained by Kalkia and her mother's True Ice. After the wolves had been slain, Hejian banished him from their tribe. Udyr retreated to the mountains, far from anyone he could hurt, and lived in solitude. Kalkia would occasionally visit the spirit walker, until she had to assume the role of warmother. Despite lifting his banishment, Udyr remained in self-imposed exile, but swore to protect Kalkia and those she loved. However, this would be the last time they would see each other.
A monk from
Ionia
arrived in the Freljord and sought out Udyr to help him master the dragon spirit within him. Udyr refused to aid the monk, but he challenged him for the right to train with him. The two battled until they reached their limits, but neither ended as the victor. The monk finally introduced himself as
Lee Sin
and noted the battle proved they both had much to learn. Lee Sin invited the spirit walker to return with him to train in Ionia, where they have spent generations training to keep the spirits at peace. With nothing him tying him to the Freljord, Udyr agreed.
Seeing a kindred spirit in the monk, the two would forge a friendship as they traveled to the Hirana Monastery. By the time they reached the Monastery, they found it besieged by
Noxian
invaders. Udyr and Lee Sin battled the soldiers of Noxus and repelled their assault. After their victory, the two asked the abbott to train them, he agreed, but self-mastery has no guarantee end. The two would spend the next several years at the Hirana Monastery, training with the Shojin Order. During this time, Udyr helped Lee find balance with the dragon spirit and embraced the harmony of the Ionian way of life.

Contemporary history

Despite enjoying the tranquility of Ionia, Udyr's powers began to plateau. Deciding to return to the Freljord to continue his growth, he would say goodbye to his friend, but not before he was gifted with one of Lee's blindfolds, a reminder to their commitment to self-mastery. When Udyr returned, he was greeted by a new conflict between the Avarosans and the Winter's Claw. The Avarosans wanted to unite the Freljord under one banner, but Udyr saw that as detrimental to the land's spiritual health, believing that struggle and conflict were needed to keep the Freljord healthy. Instead, he offered his counsel to his old tribe, the Winter's Claw, and was met by
Sejuani
, the daughter of Kalkia. Despite accepting his aid, Sejuani was weary of Udyr, having heard the stories of his bloodlust and uncontrollable power. He would earn her trust and mentored the young warmother, watching her become a fierce leader, the two becoming as close as father and daughter.
Udyr was eventually called to a meeting by the other spirit walkers. During his journey, he encountered the Seal Sister, disguised as an old woman, who asked for his help in several impossible tasks. Entertained by his futile attempts, she gave him her blessing in the form of salty bread and icy water. When he consumed them, spiritual magic surged through Udyr, causing him to pass out. When he awoke, he felt new power coursing through him and continued his journey south. When Udyr reached the meeting of the spirit walkers, they discussed a strange spiritual shift they had all felt. Fearing the Freljord was dying, Udyr believed the cause to be the Avarosans. Their actions in unifying the Freljord had deprived it of the challenge necessary to sustain its spiritual health. While some were skeptical of his theory, others agreed, and pledged their aid to him and the Winter's Claw.

Growing food shortages in the already barren tundra would force the Winter's Claw to more aggressively expand their territory. Weakened by the famine and not wanting to see more of her tribesmen fall, Sejuani proposed allying themselves with the Ursine of the
Volibear
. Udyr was called upon to aid in negotiations, but the spirit walker did not trust the Storm Bear or his ilk. Despite his objections, Sejuani remained determined in forging the alliance, and not wanting to see her harmed, Udyr agreed to aid her.
The Winter's Claw summoned the Ursine, led by the Hounded Lord, a former pupil of Udyr. When Sejuani attempted to negotiate with the Hounded Lord, he deferred her to their god, the Volibear, and summoned him to their meeting. Speaking through both Udyr and the Hounded Lord, Volibear questioned what battle would be worthy of his support. Sejuani vowed to raze the southern farms, destroy their settlements, and conquer the Freljord, pleased with these terms the Storm Bear agreed to lend her his strength, if she asked. Udyr tried to object before Sejuani could accept his offer, but was paralyzed by fear. When the Volibear demanded a sacrifice, Udyr instead offered the war and its dead, enraging him. The spirit walker goaded the god into accepting their offer and the Ursine would join the Winter's Claw in their next raid. In the aftermath of the battle, Udyr surveyed the damage inflicted by the Winter's Claw and the Ursine, noting that they were gaining more power. He confronted the avatar of the Volibear and vowed to protect Sejuani and prevent him from taking her.
Some time later, Udyr would take a leave of absence from the Winter's Claw, needing time away from the spirits to strengthen his will.
