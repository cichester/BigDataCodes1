In life and in his youth, Pyke worked on the slaughterhouse docks to earn a living, he found work at the Red Dock and it didn't take him long to get used to the business, the hard work and its minimum wage. But deep down he aspired for more and every time he saw a crew arrive with huge creatures to sell his desire grew more and more, he worked hard and finally managed to stand out and join a crew. Pyke demonstrated great talent for
Buhru
-style harpoon hunting, earning the title of the best harpooner of his time.
One day while his ship was sailing, a Jaull Fish appeared, one of the most coveted and strongest monstrous fish in all of Runeterra since its oil had magical properties. Pyke without hesitation jumped into the sea into the mouth of the fish to try to kill it, but the fish emitted a powerful scream which called a herd of Jaull Fish which began to push the boat.
The desperate captain was forced to cut Pyke's lifeline. The last thing he saw was the horrified faces of his companions as they saw him being devoured by the monstrous fish. However, in the jaw of the fish Pyke survived, when he opened his eyes he saw lights which were watching him, something mysterious crushed his mind and showed him visions of his companions benefiting from his death.
The magical oils of the Jaul fish changed Pyke who now only had in his mind a great desire for revenge and punishment, granting him supernatural powers, eventually Pyke left the monster and returned to Bilgewater determined to get revenge.

Due to the fear he instilled in Bilgewater, Illaoi, the high priestess of the Buhru, decided to put a stop to the Red Dock Ripper, leaving the Serpent Isles and venturing into Bilgewater to try to track him down. When she was about to kill a retired captain, Pyke encountered Illaoi and her followers. At first he did not see interest in killing her, but when he saw how insistent she was on stopping him, he prepared to fight her.
The battle was fierce, but Illaoi finally managed to overpower Pyke. Seeing that he was an undead, she felt disgusted since the undead were a blasphemy to her religion. So she subjected him to the test of Nagakabouros knowing that due to his undead nature he would not survive and would be crushed and destroyed by the power of the Goddess.
However, Pyke managed to survive, because to the confusion of Illaoi, the Goddess considered him worthy. Pyke was left stunned and with his mind spinning wondering what she had done to him, but he still had enough strength to escape and fled from a disconcerted Illaoi.
