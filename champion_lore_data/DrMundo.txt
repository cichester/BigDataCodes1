The man now known as
Dr. Mundo
was born and raised in
Zaun
. He grew up to be a large man, able to physically intimidate others. He had a friendly and good-natured personality and would often use nicknames for people. As an adult, despite his friendly conduct, he worked as henchman and enforcer for a chem-baron.

The Madman of Zaun

After making a mistake that infuriated his boss, the chem-baron decided to make an example out of the enforcer. He was committed to Osweld Asylum, where he was experimented on. Suffering through the cruel treatments, the enforcer's body grew muscular than he already was, yet his brain deteriorated. Eventually, he lost all memories of his previous life, including his name and that of his boss. Instead he constructed a new reality from his surroundings, mistaking his restraining jacket for the coat of a doctor, and took on the name and profession
Dr. Mundo
.
Over time, Mundo 'treated' everyone in the asylum, killing and dismembering them. When the chem-baron returned to collect his enforcer, Mundo treated him as well, killing him on an operating table. After the man tragically died during the surgery, Dr. Mundo stepped outside for the first time and recognized many potential patients that need to be 'cured'.

One day,
Dr. Mundo
fought

Appearance

Dr. Mundo is a towering man enhanced by Chemtech medicine and implants. His already large body gained even more muscles during his torture at the asylum, which also led to his purple skin and blue tongue. He currently wears a ragged restraining jacket, even though it is much too small for his figure.

Personality
[

Mundo believes himself to be a doctor and everyone else to be his patients. This is a psychotic delusion/escapist reality, and he often injures, dismembers, or even kills his 'patients' without realizing it. Despite all this, Mundo seems to care for his 'patients,' becoming sad when his 'cures' don't work. He works tirelessly to cure these people of these supposed 'diseases' and is a generally caring but crazy person.

Physical Strength
: Dr. Mundo was naturally a strong person working as an enforcer and bodyguard for a chem-baron. The treatments he was exposed to amplified his muscle growth, making him stronger than regular humans.
Limited Cognitive Capabilities
: Dr. Mundo was traumatized while subjected to torture, and now lives in an escapist reality. He believes himself to be a doctor that has to 'treat' other citizens, but in reality is hurting, dismembering or even killing them. He is known to randomly assault people on the street.

fought against Ekko in the Sump level
