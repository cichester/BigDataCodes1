Early life

Kaisa was an ordinary girl born in the southern deserts of Shurima. During her tenth summer, she came upon a pen of sacrificial goats. The girl tried to release the animals but then, suddenly, the ground shook, flashes of light scorched the sky, and a rift opened up the earth. The rift swallowed up the entire village and everyone inside.
Now trapped under the desert, Kaisa could hear the faint voices of others trapped inside. But soon, hers was the only voice left. The first void creature she encountered was about her size. After being knocked down by the voidling, Kaisa drove her knife into its heart, killing it.
Although the creature was dead, its flesh clung to Kaisa’s arm. She was unable to remove it and soon enough, it started growing around her as though it was becoming part of her. She was able to use the second skin as armor against other void creatures. The longer she survived against the void, the greater her confidence grew until she finally managed to escape back to the desert surface. No longer was she the little girl who fell into the rift but was now a fearless hunter of the void.

Monstrous

After many years below the surface, Kai'Sa rememerges to the surface. A young girl named Illi discovers Kai'Sa beside a pit. Kai'Sa guides Illi on how to confront the impending Void threat. Illi, brave and determined, stands by Kai'Sa's side as they face Void creatures. Kai'Sa imparts the wisdom she gained from fighting the
Voidborn
over the years to Illi. She advises her to starve the Void and explains the necessity of running at times. When Illi's village searches for her, Kai'Sa encourages Illi to go to her father and prepares her for the challenges ahead.
In the depths of the earth, Kai'Sa navigates the Void-infested underworld. She finds a leader of a nearby settlement up on the surface. She captures him in order to show him the imminent threat below. As they journey through treacherous tunnels, Kai'Sa reflects on her altered perception, her symbiotic relationship with the living armor, and the sacrifices she made to survive in the darkness.
As they emerge closer to the surface than expected, Kai'Sa realizes the urgency of the impending Void threat. The leader, initially blind to the darkness, witnesses the horrors of the abyss. Thousands of
monstrous creatures
emerge, their malevolent intent clear. Kai'Sa confronts the leader, urging him to understand the danger and protect his people. The leader, still blind to the imminent threat his people face, pleads to be released. Kai'Sa contemplates the morality of her actions, torn between saving lives and succumbing to her predatory instincts. The living armor hungers for the leader's essence, but she resists, determined to safeguard the surface.
Fighting through the creatures, Kai'Sa brings the leader back to the surface, only to discover a settlement unaware of the imminent danger. Setting a warning marker, she realizes her past actions inadvertently attracted the
Voidborn
. Panic ensues as she unleashes destructive energy to force the settlement's evacuation. As night falls, Kai'Sa stands on a rock spire, witnessing the approaching Void horde. The settlement evacuates, harboring fear and hatred for the once-human girl. Kai'Sa embraces her role as their protector, ready to face the monsters and become the necessary monster to ensure the survival of those she now considers her people.

The Call

Kai'Sa meets Taliyah

In the desolate void-ridden landscape, Kai'Sa, navigates a purposeful Void tunnel that defies the chaotic nature of the Void. As she confronts the newly discovered
Voidborn
she dubs "Lamplights", she battles relentlessly, only to find herself overwhelmed. In a twist of fate,
Taliyah
rescues Kai'Sa from the clutches of the Lamplights. Together, they return to a community of survivors in Taliyah's camp, where initial fear and skepticism towards Kai'Sa gradually transform into trust and acceptance through shared meals and vulnerable moments.
Amidst the flickering firelight and the scent of roasting meat, Kai'Sa contends not only with her physical injuries but also the weight of the survivors' gaze, haunted by the fear of the unknown.
Kai'Sa
begins to understand the power of alliances and the shared struggle against the pervasive darkness, as she decides to stay and heal.
As the group shares tales of their losses and hopes, Kai'Sa remains skeptical of a mythical sanctuary called
Xolan
, proposed by a fellow survivor. Tensions rise when Taliyah expresses determination to lead the group to Xolan, across the
Sai Kahleek
. Kai'Sa warns of the perils, revealing her firsthand knowledge of the deadly
Xer'Sai
that infest the area. Despite her objections, Taliyah, fueled by hope and a plan to build stone bridges for safe passage, remains resolute in her quest.
As the survivors cross the
Sai Kahleek
desert, they encounter a nest of
Xer'Sai
. Kai'Sa takes matters into her own hands to protect the group, but the situation escalates as a colossal
6
Xer'sai Dunebreaker
emerges, threatening the survivors. After barely defeating the Voidborn and saving the survivors, they contemplate a new destination. Taliyah agrees with Kai'Sa that there is no save haven. So Taliyah decides to make one. Kai'Sa and Taliyah set out to Xolan alone in order to defeat the Xer'Sai that live their and make Xolan a safe haven for all the Southern people of
Shurima
.
Taliyah and Kai'Sa arrived in
Xolan
to find the town abandoned and destroyed. They were then attacked by a group of
Xer'Sai
, but fended them off before a sinkhole appeared in the ground.
Rek'Sai
emerged from the pit, and Kai'Sa lured her back underground. This allowed Taliyah to bring the statue of
Xolaani
, the 'faceless god', over the sinkhole to prevent Rek'Sai from re-emerging.

Bel'Veth confronts Kai'Sa with the truth

After plunging back into the
Void
-invested grounds of southern
Shurima
, Kai'Sa found herself ensnared in the depths of the
Lavender Sea
. Navigating through the unnatural environment, she eventually came face to face with its monstrous empress,
Bel'Veth
. Overwhelmed by the empress's formidable strength, Kai'Sa succumbed swiftly, defeated and confined to one of the many grotesque walls that adorned the fake sea.
Within the ominous presence of Bel'Veth, Kai'Sa's reality shattered anew as the empress unveiled the haunting truth about her father,
Kassadin
. Though still alive, the Void had shattered Kassadin's mind, leaving him lost in the ancient abyss. As Kai'Sa grappled with the shock of her father's existence, Bel'Veth delved into the history of the Void, explaining the symbiotic corruption between the Void and reality, where both realms influenced and tainted each other.
Bel'Veth presented Kai'Sa with an ultimatum. The survival of the world hinged on an uneasy alliance – Kai'Sa must assist the empress in eradicating her progenitors, the
Watchers
. In return, Bel'Veth offered Kai'Sa time to devise a plan to defeat her, confident in the belief that the girl stood no chance against her might. Ordering Kai'Sa to "find the Watchers and confirm the truth," Bel'Veth released her captive, prompting Kai'Sa to instinctively rocket towards the surface, escaping the
Lavender Sea
.

Spending many years alone in the Void-infested

catacombs away from humanity has made Kai'sa very stoic, calculative and not very communicative. Despite her horrible circumstances, she still longs to be with other people and is still capable of connecting with others like
Taliyah
and
Ezreal
. She has shown to have a strong sense of duty towards the other desert-dwelling people of
Shurima
as she acts as their silent protector against Void predators despite the possible disdain she might receive from revealing herself.
