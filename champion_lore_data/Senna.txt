Early life
[

Senna was born on a small island off the coast of Demacia. As a girl, she found a shipwreck, washed ashore, and attempted to explore it. As she did so, a spark of life entered her, and she sensed the Black Mist reaching out to trap her. Senna and her village survived the Harrowing which visited them after, thanks to a Sentinel of Light named Urias. But after the encounter, it seemed that the Mist haunted Senna, following wherever she went. Urias took her under his wing, and started training her to fight back. Senna learned to keep others at arm's length, for anyone she let get near was always hurt when the Black Mist found her.
When Urias was slain by wraiths which had followed her, Senna reluctantly travelled to Demacia, to inform his family. There, she met his son Lucian, who accompanied her to Urias' parting vigil. To Senna's surprise, Lucian managed to fire his father's gun, when more of the undead attacked them. As she trained him to become a Sentinel, she also fell in love.
Lucian, however, became obsessed with "curing" Senna of her curse. That obsession led them to a forgotten crypt where they fought Thresh, the Chain Warden. So close to discovering a cure, Lucian refused to retreat... and Senna took Thresh's hook to save him. Her soul was dragged into Thresh's lantern, and Lucian would spend several years trying to free her.
For months, Senna was unable to come to terms with her own terms. Gradually, she learned how to draw the Black Mist to her, away from others. She freed as many souls as she could, including lost Sentinels from whom she learned that she wasn't cursed with death, but with an abundance of life. She learned that the master of the Mist searched for what she possessed. Sometimes, she was even able to rally the souls within to rebel against Thresh.

Redeemed

As Lucian drove his pistol into Thresh's lantern, Senna escaped, shrouded in death and wielding a cannon made from other Sentinels' relic weapons. She used it to protect Lucian from Thresh's attack and then she sent Thresh flying, immediately afterwards the souls of the lantern were beginning to be absorbed again and she began to drag Senna as well. But Lucian managed to quickly reach her to hug her to avoid the flashlight would absorb it again.

Senna is portrayed as a low, toned and curvaceous black woman, her hair is long black tied with dreadlocks falling to one side, as a child her eyes were hazel brown. But when she exposed to the magical mist her eyes changed color to bright spectral green which shine an intense green when the black mist is near it.
She wears tight-fitting black and grayish light armor that covers her entire body and always wears a white caped hood with gold trim on her head, possibly a sentinel garment since it carries a pin with the faction's crest.

Personality
[

edit source
]

Senna is a brave and quite determined girl, having been constantly running away from the black mist had made her become quite a hardened and distant person, but she started to be more open after she met Lucian.
After being freed and resurrected she acquired an ideology that life needs death as much as death needs life, since then she has dedicated herself to helping the wraith find peace.

Abilities

Wraith Physiology:
As a child, Senna was bonded to a fetter of
Isolde's
soul, blessing her with life but also cursing her by attracting the Black Mist of the
Shadow Isles
. Because of this curse, Senna's soul managed to survive inside
Thresh's
lantern, having been capable of communicating with the other souls. As a wraith, Senna can manifest her form into one that resembles her human body, but she is capable of transforming into a
cloud of Black Mist
at will.
Black Mist Manipulation:
Thanks to her curse, Senna is capable of manipulating the Black Mist to an extent, granting her near-perfect control over it and the souls trapped within it. This has allowed her to manifest her own form at will, commune with the dead and
cleanse
souls influenced by the Black Mist. In order to cleanse these souls, Senna willingly takes the mist into her own body, protected from its influence thanks to her curse, and firing the mist out as
globules
and
bolts of darkness
.
Relic Cannon Proficiency:
Senna wields a massive cannon forged from the relic stones of now deceased
Sentinels
she encountered within Thresh's lantern. Senna can wield this massive weapon with ease, capable of firing out bolts of combined
darkness and light combined
, damaging her enemies as well as healing and protecting her allies. Just like all Sentinel weapons, the relic stones in Senna's cannon are designed to specifically hurt undead wraiths of the Shadow Isles.
Undead Hunting Mastery:
Having trained as a Sentinel since childhood, Senna is extremely well versed in hunting the
Undead
, particularly the wraiths of the Shadow Isles. Not only is she well versed on their natural weaknesses, but she has a particular talent in being able to free their souls from the Black Mist.
Leadership:
As the current captain of the new generation of Sentinels, Senna is an extremely competent leader, having been able to recruit several new Sentinels during
Viego's
global ruination.
