Renata was born in the city of Zaun, her parents were brilliant alchemists who used their knowledge to make medicine, but they had a big heart that even rejected the money they were given, Renata got used to going to bed hungry because of it.
When she was old enough Renata was finally able to join the family business, but she was not as skilled in alchemy as her parents were, but her ambition prompted her to start charging higher class Zaunites.
She proudly gave the money she had earned to her parents, but instead of using it to live more comfortably, they used it to finance research into a new medicine that could prolong life. In Piltover, the leaders of the most powerful clans found out about the Glasc family's experiments and, not wanting a threat, they paid some vigilantes to kill them.
That same night Renata woke up suddenly to the screams of pain and fear from her parents, because they had set fire to their house around her. Renata tried to save them but lost an arm in the process. When the fire was extinguished, Renata was the only survivor, with only her parents' investigation in her hand.

Renata Glasc is a cunning and ruthless woman, determined to achieve her goals no matter what, having built her convictions from her past and doing anything to achieve her goals. Having survived the brutality of Zaun's streets, Renata decided to never again be put down.
Unlike other chembarons, Renata prefers to avoid violence, and instead resorts to manipulation, convincing others to do her bidding and satisfy her desires by tying their interest together, thus putting them in debt towards her. To manipulate the masses, she often feigns benevolence, taking advantage of crisis and tragedies to make herself a savior.
The trauma from her loss has made her deeply resentful of the idea of charity, deeming it foolish. She has a particular hatred towards
