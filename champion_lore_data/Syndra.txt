Early life

Syndra was born in Navori, Ionia, within a small village. She possessed a distracted nature, causing her parents to frequently punish her. Each time she was punished, Syndra sought solace in her secret hideout - the Spectral Willow. There, she confided her sorrows to the tree in cries and whispers, finding refuge in its roots.
However, one fateful day, Syndra's brother, Evard, and his friends discovered her hideout and began taunting her. Despite her efforts to disregard them, one of Evard's friends threw mud at her, drawing blood and igniting a fierce rage within the young, tormented girl. Three luminous orbs materialized around Syndra, causing the willow tree to wither and Evard and his friends to flee. Syndra's village, reliant on the willow tree for its magical essence, blamed Syndra's family for its demise, resulting in their eventual exile.

Fae'lor

Following their exile from Navori, Syndra and her family traversed Ionia for days until reaching Fae'lor, a renowned magic school of Syndra's time specializing in the taming of wild magic. Faced with limited alternatives, Syndra's parents made the decision for her to remain at the school to refine her magic.
Syndra spent years in the school, initially content in her pursuit of magical knowledge. However, she eventually grew frustrated as she sensed a waning in her abilities over time, instead of her power growing stronger everyday as it used to. She confronted Konigen, her teacher, who then revealed that Syndra's extraordinary magical prowess had compelled him to seal her powers. Shocked by this revelation and betrayal, Syndra reproached her teacher for this betrayal. Her rage overwhelmed her once more, causing her to unleash a sphere of energy at her teacher, killing him.
Consumed by immense pain and loneliness, Syndra ascended into the sky, summoning three orbs of energy that sapped the spiritual essence of Fae'lor. She unleashed devastation upon the entire island, indiscriminately eliminating anyone in her path. This prompted the intervention of the Spirit of Ionia.
The spirit created a rift in the earth, restraining Syndra with thick vines and pulling her into the crevice. Instead of killing her, however, the spirit submerged Syndra in a mystical pond, casting her into a magic slumber where she would remain for hundreds of years.

The Dreaming Pool

The Dreaming Pool

The mystical pond became Syndra's prison, where the Spirit of Ionia would keep her indefinitely for breaking the balance of Ionia's nature. While in her sleep, Syndra experienced a repeating dream that prevented her from waking up. The dream depicted the moment young Syndra got humiliated by her brother and his friends, her rage and sorrow withering the Spectral Willow, and her creating the three luminous magical spheres as a result.
The moment the dream reached its climax, with Syndra rising into the air about to attack her tormentors, the dream would stop and repeat from the beginning, endlessly. This caused Syndra to be confused and suspect that something was very wrong. The dream, however, kept repeating for millennia, keeping her calm within The Dreaming Pool and away from the rest of the world.
Countless years passed, and the time of the Noxus Invasion over Ionia would arrive. Syndra now had a jailer, Kalan, that made sure no one would disturb her prison.
Due to the war, a group of Vastaya began seeking help from anyone who would be willing to help them fight back against Noxus. They learnt about Syndra's existence, but some were hesitant about freeing her due to the harm that this could cause to the world. After they argued back and forth, one of the Vastaya finally decided to launch at the pond, blade in hand, and grabbed Syndra by the neck, determined to kill her.
Syndra would experience her endless dream one last time, as at that moment her eyes snapped wide open and she began to lift into the air once more, stopping the Vastaya's futile attempts to hurt her.

Elevating Faelor's temple

Syndra slipped free of the twisting roots that had ensnared her limbs for so many years, and emerged, gasping. Out of sheer force of will, a dark, elegant outfit covered her body, finishing with a two-pronged crown that resembled a pair of tall, curving horns. The group tried to calm her down and reason with her, but she refused to be a pawn in someone else's game. Consumed by the wrath of realizing being trapped in The Dreaming Pool for so long, Syndra killed the Vastaya group and hurled her jailer into the pond where she was once trapped in.
She began to lift the temple into the air, huge chunks of stone falling around her, which she used to entomb her jailer completely beneath the ground. After what felt like an earthquake, the silhouette of the greatest towers and ramparts was hanging against the night sky. She finally drifted away, bringing the remains of the ruined temple along with her.
Syndra was back into the world.

Her shoulders are covered by two spiky shoulder pauldrons that curve upwards. Her legs are covered by tall black & purple knee socks that reveal part of her feet.

Personality

As a child Syndra was a very withdrawn girl due to the constant abuse of her family; she just wanted to be alone and seek solace in Ionia's nature. Over time, that sadness turned into rage.
As an adult, Syndra developed a spiteful and explosive personality as a result of being mistreated, betrayed and controlled by everyone around her. She has a deep grudge against Ionians, as they are part of the group responsable for all the pain she has has to endure. It is implied that she currently wants to be left alone, but her current whereabouts are unknown.

Abilities

]

Mage
:
Syndra was born with powerful innate magical abilities that have the potential to strengthen as she hones her skills and deepens her understanding of magic.
Dark Energy Manipulation:
Syndra possesses an uncommon form of magic. Unlike traditional magic affinities tied to elements like
light
,
earth
, or
electricity
, her magic stems and draws power from raw, concentrated emotions. This magic's immense power led Konigen to attempt to suppress it rather than allow Syndra to learn how to control it. Her negativity coalesces into spheres of pure darkness capable of unleashing massive waves of destruction and consuming everything in its path.
Telekinesis
: Syndra can harness her dark energy to elevate objects, beings, and structures, manipulating them according to her will. Floating effortlessly instead of walking, she can also fly with ease. Notably, she exhibited immense power by lifting the entire temple of Fae'lor and suspending it in the sky through sheer force of will.
Spiritual Leeching:
Syndra's dark energy strips away the natural spiritual energies of her surroundings, depleting the environment of its spiritual essence. This depletion of spirit magic affects
Ionia
's landscapes, crucial for their vitality, thus leaving them barren and devoid of life.

Ionians

]

Due to her abusive upbringing and being imprisoned for decades in Fae'lor of Ionia, she has grown hateful against all
Ionians
to an extent that she even approves of
Noxian
presence. However, she has no prior knowledge of Noxus before the events of her release. All the pain she has endured has been caused by Ionians, so she doesn't have any reason to side with them.

Noxians
[

Although she seems to thank the Noxians for standing against the people who locked her, she also has little care for them, killing all of the invaders on the fortress and destroying a Noxian warship with a mere glance of her eyes.
