Getting kicked out of his Tribe
[

edit source
]

Kong is a member of the
Shimon
, a monkey-like species of
Vastaya
who sought wisdom throughout their lives and turn into stone-like forms upon death to begin the cycle anew. Kong used to play pranks on the other Shimon to their annoyance, and once told them that an elemental dragon was going to burn down their home. While they all fled in fear, Kong was laughing. This caused the other Shimon to run out of patience with him and kick him out of the tribe, so Kong decided to find people who would appreciate his sense of humor. He proclaimed himself "The Monkey King" and challenged humans to duels or games of cunning. One time, he encountered a group of
Noxians
whom chased him into the forest, and he didn't reveal himself until he was sure that they had left.

Meeting the last master of
Wuju

Kong wished to meet the combat masters of
Wuju
, but to his shock the Wuju village had already been destroyed by the
Noxian
forces, and there was only a single man who meditated in the ruins. Kong decided to challenge him to a fight, but the warrior beat him instantly. For weeks, Wukong kept challenging him, only to be outsmarted and beaten no matter which angle he came from or which strategies he used, even trying to distract him with hilarious jokes or tampering with his tea.
Kong knelt to the warrior and asked to learn his ways. He accepted and introduced himself as
Master Yi
, the last master of Wuju, and promised to help turn the Shimon's recklessness into a skilled fighting style. As the two trained together, Yi refused to talk about his past nor why he refused to leave the village. Kong decided to challenge Yi to a duel, making a deal where if Kong won then Yi would tell him his secrets, but if Yi won then Kong would not speak for a year. Yi eagerly accepted the challenge. When the day came, Kong lured Yi into a field of smokepoppies. As Yi was about to make his move on Kong, he instead hit a straw decoy while the real Kong struck him by surprise and grappled him to the ground.
Afterwards, Yi told Kong the truth: he and his disciples had left to defend
Ionia
from the Noxian troops, but the village was destroyed and most of the villagers had been killed by the attack, leaving Yi as a sole survivor and one of the only Wuju practitioners currently left in existence. Kong realized that he had wanted to protect the Shimon the same way, despite them casting him out. Proud of his student and finding a new sense of purpose thanks to him, Master Yi gave Wukong a special staff reserved for the best students of Wuju. From then, Kong was given the name Wukong.

Continuing the Wuju Legacy

Even after the war had long passed, the Noxians were still encroaching Ionia and oppressing the natives. Wukong and Master Yi made it their mission to combat injustice and hatred wherever they found it.

(TBA)

Personality
[

edit source
]

Even back when he was known as Kong, Wukong was always proud of his own fighting skills and wished to be the best. He enjoys boasting about himself and dared anyone to question his abilities. He used to have a habit of playing pranks on the other
Shimon
, and had no qualms about crossing any lines since he had scared the other
Shimon
into hysteria and didn't regret it when they kicked him out of the tribe.
He always wanted to challenge
Master Yi
because he admired Yi's skills and wanted to be respected back. Training with Yi has humbled Wukong significantly, to the point where he realized the true worth of defending his people, and he values Master Yi's teachings a lot. Even though Wukong still remains arrogant, sometimes his more reckless manners of approach can turn out better than the slow and safe ways like Yi's methods.

Wukong was trained in the Art of Wuju by
Master Yi
. Wukong's original name was 'Kong'. When Kong agreed to become his student,
Master Yi
dubbed him 'Wukong', effectively naming him after the Wuju style. Due to this, they share two similar
quotes
.

Ahri

Wukong and
Ahri
are listed as related champions for unknown reason, possibly because of both being
Vastaya
.

Ting

Ting was once a pupil of Wukong, but he was so overconfident in his own Wuju skills that Wukong sent him to
Master Yi
to teach him humility.
