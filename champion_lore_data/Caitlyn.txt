Childhood

Born to the wealthy
Kiramman
family, Caitlyn grew up among the most influential nobles and merchants in all of
Piltover
. However, she always felt that her parents, especially her mother
Cassandra
, sheltered her, thus hindering her personal growth in their hopes of protecting her and convincing her to follow in her footsteps to effectively carry on their family name.

From a young age, Caitlyn learned to be a very skilled marksman. Once, she joined a sharpshooting competition in Piltover and won a trophy, despite feeling she did not deserve it. After the contest, she confronted her opponent,
Sheriff Grayson
of the
Piltover Enforcers
, about throwing the competition for her, suspecting that her parents had paid her to do it. Grayson admitted to letting her win only because she felt that Caitlyn deserved it, not because of her parents, then asked her what the young Caitlyn was shooting for.
[

]
Around this time, Caitlyn became close with
Jayce Talis
, an Academy student that her parents were sponsoring. One day, Caitlyn was helping Jayce when his laboratory exploded after a robbery, and the danger Caitlyn had been put in angered her father,
Tobias
. Although Caitlyn and her mother were able to prevent Jayce's banishment from Piltover, the trial still ended in his expulsion from the Academy, which brought great shame to both House Talis and Clan Kiramman. As a result of this, Caitlyn's parents forbade Caitlyn of any further interactions with Jayce,
[

but he would soon manage to prove that his research was viable, thus revolutionizing Piltover and regaining the Kirammans' favor. After this, Caitlyn was allowed to be friends with him again.

Becoming an Enforcer
[

]

When she was an adult, Caitlyn joined Piltover Enforcers as a junior officer, against her parents' wishes. The other enforcers often made fun of her for her station and name, and despite her efforts to use her intelligence to help solve real crimes, her parents would use their influence to have Caitlyn placed in minor roles away from any danger. Caitlyn frequently went behind the back of the current Sheriff,
Marcus
, to investigate the mysterious, redacted documents related to cold cases, including the murder of Grayson and other homicides by
shimmer
-enhanced thugs, as well as investigating the activities of several industrial
crime bosses
, including
Smeech
,
Chross
, and
Renni
. Despite the department repeatedly stonewalling and hiding information from her, Caitlyn's investigation into the files eventually led her to believe there was a far greater level of criminal organization in the undercity, and she hoped to figure out who this
mastermind
was, even if it meant disobeying regulation.

Piltovan Bicentennial
[

Bombing at the Academy Square
[
edit

edit source
]

At the celebration of
Piltover's
bicentennial Progress Day, Caitlyn was assigned to guard the
Kirammans'
tent—a direct result of her
Cassandra's
interference. Irritated by her post, she left to investigate a nearby crime scene by herself. After observing and photographing the details, she found
Gustove
, an injured henchman who refused to give the name of his
employer
, and before Caitlyn could question him further, the
Sheriff
arrived and admonished Caitlyn for leaving her post and interfering with the chain of command. As punishment, Marcus assigned Caitlyn an extra shift at the fair before arresting Gustove and sending him on a boat to Stillwater Hold.
That night at the celebration, Caitlyn noticed a fire on the premises, and being lured by what sounded like the voice of a child, she and the other guards moved to rescue her. The voice was a trap and Caitlyn was nearly killed in an explosion, as she caught a glimpse of a
blue-haired terrorist
from the undercity breaking into the building where
Jayce
was giving his Progress Day speech. After the attack, Jayce's newest invention—a
hextech
gemstone—was stolen, and Caitlyn's parents had her discharged from the enforcers. Caitlyn, having already gathered all her evidence, decided to continue her investigation on her own, even without her department's help.
[

Undercity Investigation
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Taking a boat to Stillwater, Caitlyn decided to continue her interrogation of Gustove, only to learn that he had been recognized and beaten up by another prisoner and was now unable to speak. So she wouldn't leave empty-handed, Caitlyn decided to interview Gustove's assailant instead: Inmate #516, whose name was
Vi
.
[

]
Caitlyn questioned the hardened undercity criminal, whose background and crimes had been completely scratched clean from any records, and after showing her the evidence, learned that Gustove's employer was an industrialist named
Silco
. Since Caitlyn had never been to the undercity, she decided to enlist Vi's help to guide her, forging an order from Jayce to have her released. The two then set off to begin Caitlyn's investigation, with Caitlyn bringing along her personal hunting rifle as a weapon.
[
4
]
Vi acted as Caitlyn's guide in
Zaun
, stealing clothes so they could blend in and speaking to residents she knew for clues about Silco, including
Jericho
and
Babette
. Eventually, the trail led them to
Sevika
, who Silco's most-trusted lieutenant. Vi was gravely injured in her battle with Sevika, but Caitlyn managed to save her using her rifle. Caitlyn had overheard a name from Sevika, Silco's daughter
Jinx
, after which she hurried Vi to safety.
Vi directed her to an old abandoned house by a den of shimmer addicts, and Caitlyn was horrified by how much the people in the undercity were suffering. With the help of one of the addicts,
Huck
, she traded her old rifle for medicine that was made from shimmer and used it to treat Vi. Vi revealed that her parents had been killed by enforcers long ago, and that the reason she returned to the undercity was to find her long-lost sister,
Powder
. After they escaped from Silco and his goons, Vi ran far ahead of Caitlyn to a tower with a blue flare, and when Caitlyn caught up with them, she realized to her horror that Vi's sister was not only Jinx, but also the same thief she was hunting who had stolen the hextech gemstone. After a tense confrontation, the three of them were attacked by
Firelights
, who took the gemstone and kidnapped Caitlyn and Vi.
[
9
]
At the Firelight base, Caitlyn was angry with Vi for keeping her sister a secret from her, but later learned that Vi was old friends with the Firelight leader,
Ekko
, who was leading the resistance against Silco's criminal empire. Though Ekko did not trust Caitlyn, she felt her investigation had revealed a great deal about how much the undercity had suffered because of Piltover, and that if they shared what they had learned with the Piltover Council, they too would be willing to help end the cycle of violence. Ending the current crisis meant they had to return the hextech gemstone, and with some convincing from Vi, Ekko agreed on the condition that he be the one to deliver it back to them.
At the Bridge of Progress, Caitlyn and Ekko bid Vi goodbye as she left to find Jinx, and the two of them met with the Sheriff of the Enforcers, Marcus, who was guarding the border with his men. After sharing her findings and showing him the gemstone, Marcus suddenly betrayed Caitlyn and attempted to shoot her, only to be caught in another of Jinx's explosions. Jinx killed the Sheriff and the other enforcers and stole the gemstone back, right before she made her way to kill Caitlyn as well. Although Caitlyn was injured, she was saved by Ekko, who held Jinx off, and Vi, who had returned to help the second she heard gunfire.
[

]

Informing the Council
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Despite having lost the gemstone to Jinx, Caitlyn decided not to give up on the results of her investigation, especially with the Sheriff's betrayal now brought to light. Vi brought Caitlyn to safety back to the Kiramman mansion, where her parents treated her injuries. Here, she convinced her mother to organize a meeting with the other Councilors, despite all the laws she had broken during her investigation. That evening, Caitlyn and Vi presented their findings, but while the Council learned the truth about Silco's conspiracy, they remained at an impasse as to what they should do about him. Most of the Council, including
Mel Medarda
, favored a peaceful solution with Zaun, but Caitlyn was shocked to learn that Jayce was in favor dismantling Silco's operations with brutal force, regardless of the casualties. Vi sided with Jayce, and after an angry outburst against the other Councilors, she was sent out. Caitlyn went after Vi, but failed to convince her to remain in Piltover, with Vi claiming that things could never work between them before walking away.
[
11
]
Several hours later, Jinx broke into Caitlyn's home while she was taking a shower, before kidnapping her and taking her hostage in the undercity. Jinx later abducted two other prisoners—Vi and Silco—and demanded that Vi shoot Caitlyn with her pistol. Vi refused, and while Jinx was distracted talking to Silco, Caitlyn managed to break herself free and stole Jinx's
minigun
before threatening her with it. After a tense standoff, Caitlyn hesitated before taking the shot, as Vi begged Caitlyn not to kill her sister. Jinx took advantage of the hesitation and knocked Caitlyn out cold, and when she came to, Jinx had killed Silco and fired a
rocket
at the Piltover Council, killing
Bolbok
,
Hoskel
, and Caitlyn's mother in the attack.
[
12
]
After her mother's funeral, Caitlyn informed the remaining Council members that the attack was caused by Jinx, and presumably told them about Silco's death.

The Kiramman Key
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Caitlyn grieved at her home with her
father
, who bestowed upon her the Kiramman key and leadership of their clan. Vi had also returned with Caitlyn to Piltover, and Caitlyn approached her, offering Vi a badge to join the Enforcers. Vi refused, since the Enforcers killed her parents. As she prepared for the memorial service for the fallen Councilors, Caitlyn's father and Mel sent Jayce to go speak with her, and Caitlyn realized that her mother's absence had given her a newfound hatred of Jinx, and that she wished Vi would have accepted her offer.
At the memorial, the service was interrupted by one of Silco's chembaron lieutenants,
Renni
, who unleashed her chemtank thugs against the councilors and civilians. The attack was put down by
Ambessa's
warband of
Noxians
, and Caitlyn, outraged that the undercity would interrupt her mother's memorial, used her family name to break into a closed Council meeting and organize a strike team—consisting of
Maddie Nolen
,
Loris
,
Steb
, and a newly recruited Enforcer Vi—to wipe out the remnants of Silco's collapsing criminal empire, including his shimmer production, the remaining chembarons, and Jinx herself.
[
13
]
As she planned her attack, Caitlyn accepted a new
hextech rifle
that Jayce had built for her, and used the Kiramman key to access her family's archives, which included information on a ventilation system her family had built to contain a toxic industrial smog called the Gray.
[
14
]

Pursuing Jinx
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Leading her strike team into Zaun, Caitlyn weaponized the Gray with deadly efficiency against the chembarons as she infiltrated their ongoing gang war, convincing
Smeech
to capture Jinx for them
[
15
]
and also defeating
Margot
and
Chross
. Once the chembarons were dealt with, Caitlyn set her sights on Jinx, tracking her through a maze of traps and tricks that sent them ever deeper into the undercity's lower levels. As they closed in on her, Vi and Caitlyn decided to send the others home for their own safety, as they both deemed Jinx their own responsibility. Caitlyn asked Vi if she was truly ready to kill her sister, and Vi explained that Powder was gone and her sister had changed beyond recognition. She asked Caitlyn not to change, and they shared a kiss in the industrial pipes of the undercity's lower levels.
They found Jinx waiting for them in
Janna's
temple, and as Vi went to lure her out, she told Caitlyn to "take the shot" if she had the opportunity. Caitlyn had the shot twice. The first was a mirror trick, and she was attacked by Sevika after revealing her position. After she had defeated Sevika, however, Vi managed to subdue Jinx, and Caitlyn had Jinx in her sights once again. Although a
Zaunite child
intervened and stepped between Jinx and the enforcers, Caitlyn believed she could have taken the shot and would not have missed. However, Vi was unwilling to take the risk and blocked her shot, before Sevika activated a bomb that blew them outside the temple with no way back inside. Realizing Vi was still unwilling to let anyone kill her sister, Caitlyn left her in the undercity and went back to Piltover.
When Caitlyn returned, she found that Jinx had launched the Gray back into Piltover, painting the town in her colors and hurting civilians in her latest attack. At the ruined Council chamber, Ambessa Medarda summoned all the noble houses and merchant clans to discuss the city's defense, and they enacted martial law, with Ambessa naming Caitlyn as commander of the city's forces. Although Caitlyn and others on her squad were shocked, Caitlyn accepted the position as Ambessa promised to help her avenge her mother's death.
[

Martial Law Period
[

A New Chemweapon
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Months passed, and despite her explosive attack against
Piltover
winning her numerous supporters and copycats among the undercity punks and anarchists,
Jinx
herself vanished from the public eye. Caitlyn worked with
Ambessa
and her second-in-command,
Rictus
, to enact a brutal occupation of
Zaun
as they hunted her down, to no avail. At some point, she began a romantic relationship with
Maddie
from her squad, who was promoted to one of her top advisors and confidantes. Ambessa's forces eventually busted a rally where many supporters of Jinx had been gathered, sending them to Stillwater. Shortly after, Jinx arrived on the scene and freed the prisoners, just as a hulking chemtech beast known as
Warwick
barged in and began a bloody rampage, massacring many of the guards.
[
16
]
Caitlyn arrived on the crime scene to investigate, and after following a trail of blood, came upon a single unopened cell containing an old doctor known only as
Singed
. Deducing him as the beast's creator and the mastermind behind the attack, Caitlyn and Ambessa interrogated and threatened him, but did not receive any answers. Later, Ambessa had Singed released on the condition he work for her and recapture his beast, Caitlyn searched her family archive for clues about his background. She discovered that he was Dr. Reveck, a disgraced Piltovan alchemist responsible for numerous unspeakable crimes, including the invention of shimmer. Under threat, Singed took Caitlyn and Ambessa to the secret room where he kept his daughter,
Orianna
, and explained that his research was to find a "cure to death" so she might live again. Despite her reservations about him, Caitlyn decided to spare the doctor's life.
[
17
]

Reunion with Vi
[
edit
|
edit source
]

As Singed worked on his device to track Warwick, Caitlyn trained with Ambessa on her warship as she taught her the
Noxian
principles. When Singed was finished, they accompanied him back to Zaun, where he led them to a massive underground
commune
led by
Viktor
, whom his followers all referred to as "the Herald." Caitlyn kept watch outside the commune as Singed returned from the negotiations, and when she saw he was being followed, she attacked the person, only realizing up close that it was
Vi
, who had dyed her hair black in Caitlyn's absence. Although they were currently enemies, Caitlyn was happy to see Vi, and when Vi explained that Warwick was her
father
, Caitlyn abandoned Ambessa's warband and helped make a plan to rescue him.
Knowing Vi was skilled at picking locks, Caitlyn gave Vi a
90 caliber net
from her rifle and pretended to capture her, taking her to Ambessa's tent to keep the warlord distracted. As Vi handled Ambessa, Caitlyn accompanied and knocked out Singed before he could inject Warwick with his serum, only to be ambushed by Rictus, who had been following her. As Rictus prepared to kill Caitlyn, she was suddenly saved by Jinx, and realized Vi had secretly brought her in on their plan to keep watch. Though this made Caitlyn angry, she did not have time to confront Vi or Jinx about it, as Viktor's cultists started screaming and Warwick suddenly went berserk, killing Rictus. Ambessa, who had recovered from Vi's attack and entered the camp, sent her forces to attack Warwick, burning everything to the ground.
[
18
]
Caitlyn and Vi eventually managed to flee back to Piltover with the help of Jinx,
Jayce
, and Jinx's companion
Isha
, who sacrificed herself so they could escape. After getting Vi to safety, Jinx handed herself in to the authorities, and Caitlyn had her locked in a cell. Later, Caitlyn had learned Ambessa was planning an invasion of the Hexgate and discussed her options with Maddie when Vi burst into the room, demanding Caitlyn release her sister, claiming she had changed in the past few months and deserved a second chance. After an argument with Vi, Caitlyn went to visit Jinx, who had become uncharacteristically solemn and defeated. Caitlyn was unwilling to forgive Jinx for killing her
mother
, but had grown exhausted of hating her. After leaving the prison in the bunker, Caitlyn reduced the number of guards to let Vi sneak in and free her sister, and returned to speak with her after Jinx trapped her and ran away. Vi began to blame herself for letting Jinx get away, but Caitlyn reassured her, and after Caitlyn apologized for seeing someone else during their months apart, the two officially reconciled and slept together in the prison cell.
[

Battle at the Hexgate
[
edit
|
edit source
]

In the makeshift Council chamber in the bunker, Caitlyn helped prepare the defense of the Hexgate alongside Jayce, Vi, and
Mel
, with their primary goal being to kill Viktor, who had joined forces with Ambessa and was about to unleash calamity onto the city. At the battle, Caitlyn and the Enforcers engaged Ambessa's forces, but at the critical moment when they were going to destroy Viktor's sphere, they were sabotaged by Maddie, who betrayed them to the Noxians. Ambessa captured Caitlyn's forces and ordered Maddie to execute her in the middle of the square, and though she was saved by Mel, they were still at the mercy of Ambessa's army.
Right then, Caitlyn's Piltovan force was saved by an army of Zaunites, who were being led by Jinx and
Ekko
on a massive war balloon. As the armies fought around them, and Viktor's puppets joined the battle, Caitlyn and Mel remained separated from the action and fought Ambessa herself, who despite being outnumbered managed to easily get the upper hand on both of them. As Ambessa held a blade to Caitlyn's face, and despite losing an eye in the process, she managed to steal Ambessa's
kaenic rookern
. This allowied Mel to cast a spell to summon a shadowy
sorceress
of the
Black Rose
, ending the warlord's life and the involvement of her army in the invasion. Viktor soon created a
massive storm
that threatened to absorb Caitlyn into his hivemind along with everyone else. He failed, and with the presumed deaths of him and Jayce the battle was over.

Aftermath
[
edit

edit source
]


After the battle, Caitlyn lamented the losses of her citizens.
Vi
also moved back into Caitlyn's mansion, and at some point after the battle, Caitlyn also learned that
Jinx
had died in an explosion. Caitlyn appeared to have her doubts, however, and after examining the remains of Jinx's explosive, she used her family archive to examine the Hexgate schematics, which listed possible routes through which Jinx might have escaped to fake her own death. Soon afterward, Caitlyn asked Vi if she was "still in this fight," to which Vi assured Caitlyn that she would stay with her no matter what.

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Caitlyn Kiramman is a tall, athletic, young
Piltovan
woman, in her early twenties. She has pale skin, piercing deep blue eyes, and a slender but toned figure. Caitlyn has shoulder length natural dark blue hair, that is tied up into a ponytail when in Zaun, and neatly brushed and out when in her enforcer uniform. Caitlyn has a mixed
Ionian
and Piltovan ancestry, the former from her father
Tobias Kiramman
. Her base outfit is a combination of white, blueish purple, and bronze colors which consists of a sheriff's uniform with a short navy blue skirt, long navy blue stockings with embellishments and bronze heeled boots and she always wears a matching top hat with the uniform which gives her a classy yet intimidating look.
Early in her career as an enforcer, Caitlyn was most frequently depicted wearing a navy-blue and gold uniform trimmed with leather accessories, sometimes complemented by a matching brimless tall navy blue hat. Her nightwear consists of a mid-thigh-length pale lavender silk nightie with thin straps, knee-length brown shorts and ankle-length white socks with navy-blue accents at the heel. While
undercover
in
Zaun
with
Vi
, Caitlyn wore a leather accented Zaunite street outfit that Vi had stolen for her shortly after they arrived in the Lanes. When Caitlyn served as tactical leader of her strike team, she would adopt a new uniform with a several red accents and a white beret, with a shiny new state-of-the-art
hextech
rifle as a weapon. As
commander
, she would start wearing a long dark cape with a high collar, but would eventually abandon the cape after breaking her alliance with
Ambessa
. After the battle at the Hexgate, Caitlyn started to wear a blue eyepatch on her left eye.
As a teenager, Caitlyn was slimmer and paler, and often wore her hair out and neatly brushed. She wore upper class Piltovan attire with navy, white, and gold accents. During the flashback, Caitlyn was also depicted wearing an earth-toned outfit, for the shooting competition in which she participated with the late Sheriff of Piltover,
Grayson
.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Caitlyn at first glance could appear naive and sheltered to some—likely due to her being raised in a wealthy, influential family. In actuality, she is compassionate, protective, determined, and stubborn in the pursuit of her goals despite the disapproval of her family. Caitlyn would always aim to unveil the hidden, criminal activities plaguing innocent people through her investigations and ultimately wants to bring them to justice and help the victims.
After becoming an enforcer, Caitlyn developed a great sense of duty and responsibility, as she wanted to be of service to the people. When
her mother
prevented her from doing police work to stop
Silco's
criminal activities, she would always despise it, as she wanted to prove herself worthy by her merits rather than be given things due to her family, and also resented being coddled as a child. After Caitlyn was almost killed in an explosion, Caitlyn's parents influenced her superiors to fire her—but Caitlyn was resolute in continuing her investigation to stop Silco's crimes. She also forged commands of her friend
Jayce Talis
in order to get
Vi
out of prison. Caitlyn has broken numerous laws in the pursuit of justice, which allowed her to expose a large amount of corruption within the
Enforcers
.
After her mother's death, Caitlyn would become consumed by vengeance, becoming agitated, impulsive, and sometimes violent in her pursuit of
Jinx
. This obsession had a destructive effect on Caitlyn's ideals and her personal life, as she cut herself off from the people who cared about her, deeming them to be distractions from her goal. After several months, Caitlyn had grown exhausted from her hatred and felt remorse for everything she had done, but believed she still had a responsibility to protect her city.

Abilities
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Genius Detective:
Caitlyn is incredibly observant, noticing the tiniest details, that most would not pay attention to. Even working without the the city's resources, Caitlyn was always able to remain three steps ahead of others, allowing her to solve criminal cases with deadly efficiency.
[
8
]
Through her analysis of documents, she was also able to uncover the conspiracy led by
Silco's
criminal network and to uncover the true identity of
Singed
. She is also able to distinctly visualize the events of crime scenes long after they have already occurred, including the rampages of
Jinx
and
Warwick
.
Expert Markswoman:
Caitlyn is an expert in the use of firearms, and uses a hextech rifle as her primary weapon. Even as a child she was highly skilled, being able to compete in a shooting competition with
Sheriff Grayson
.
Rifle Proficiency:
Like her parents, Caitlyn is skilled with a rifle. While her original rifle was never designed to see combat,
[
8
]
she would eventually replace it with a
hextech rifle
(powered by her
core
) created by her friend
Jayce
, which is far more potent than a regular rifle and is able to fire a
90 caliber net
to ensnare and stun her enemies.
Kiramman Leader:
As one of the ruling houses of
Piltover
, Caitlyn's family name holds a great deal of political and diplomatic sway, allowing her to barge into closed Council meetings unannounced and organize her specialized task force. Eventually, the Kiramman name allowed
Ambessa Medarda
to convince the Piltovan merchant clans to enact martial law by instating Caitlyn as Commander Kiramman. Caitlyn's family also commands a great deal of wealth and resources, including a ventilation system containing the Gray (which she would weaponize against
Zaun
), and the Kiramman family archives, which allow her vital insight with regards to her detective work.
Strategist:
Caitlyn is a skilled strategist, using her acumen to plan raids against several
chembarons
as she led her strike team into Zaun. Caitlyn's analysis of her environment and strategic choke points allowed her to map out an escape route with Vi from Viktor's commune, and later allowed her to help Jayce plan Piltover's defense before Ambessa's invasion.
Melee Combatant:
Though Caitlyn specializes as a marksman, she would be trained by Ambessa in close-ranged combat, learning the
Noxian
principles and being molded over time to have the skills of one of her warband. Caitlyn was able to use these techniques when she ambushed
Vi
, and would eventually employ her spear proficiency against Ambessa herself, managing to steal the general's
rookern
.

Relations
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Vi
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Vi and Caitlyn share a deep and intimate relationship. Having been the one who freed her from prison, Vi was directly responsible for changing Caitlyn's viewpoint of all
Zaunites
, showing her the reality of the living conditions in the undercity. Caitlyn's kindness and concern over Vi would lead her to give Caitlyn the nickname "Cupcake", which Caitlyn would eventually take to heart. Caitlyn would be the only person Vi would emotionally open up to, telling her about her past and current concerns. Both Vi and Caitlyn were greatly protective of each other, saving each other's lives on many occasions, and this relationship would only grow closer with time.
However, their relationship would become complicated by the fact that Vi was the sister of
Jinx
, whom Caitlyn considered to be a dangerous and unhinged lunatic who needed to be put down for
Piltover's
safety. Vi's unwillingness to let her sister get hurt by anyone, even for the greater good, led Caitlyn to hesitate the first time she had a chance to kill her, directly leading to the death of her own
mother
. After this, Caitlyn became obsessed with destroying Jinx no matter the cost, eventually closing herself off to her morals, principles, or anything she'd consider a distraction. This eventually included Vi, and she would break up with and abandon her so she wouldn't get in the way of her hunt for Jinx again.
After several months of martial law working with
Ambessa
, Caitlyn tried to forget about Vi, starting a new relationship with
Maddie
instead. However, when Caitlyn unexpectedly met Vi again at
Viktor's
commune, they reconnected quickly, having both grown unhappy with their lives in the other's absence. While Vi's recent reconciliation with Jinx gave Caitlyn pause, Caitlyn had ultimately grown weary of hating her and allowed Vi to help her sister escape. After she finally got Vi alone, they ultimately reaffirmed their love for one another, during which time Caitlyn felt guilty for seeing someone else, but Vi did not care. The two of them are currently in a romantic relationship, with Vi seemingly living with Caitlyn in the Kiramman mansion and always ready to accompany her anywhere.

Cassandra Kiramman
[
edit
|
edit source
]

As her mother, Cassandra always expected Caitlyn to be a good example worthy of the Kiramman name. She thus disapproved of Caitlyn's decision to become an enforcer, believing it was not a job befitting her station. Cassandra would use her influence as Councilor to make sure Caitlyn was only ever posted in unexciting locations for her safety. When Caitlyn almost died in an explosion caused by
Jinx
, Cassandra used her influence to get her fired from her job. Caitlyn was frequently vexed by her mother preventing her from seeing the real world and would actively avoid her because of it. She also believed Cassandra was more concerned about the optics of her actions than helping the victims of
Silco's
criminal activities. Cassandra in turn would disapprove of Caitlyn's misfit behavior, where she would break regulation to investigate Silco's activities. Even so, Cassandra cared about her daughter and appreciated her service to people, despite disapproving of her methods. When Caitlyn asked her to let her present evidence of Silco's conspiracy to the Piltover Council, Cassandra obliged even though her police work was unsanctioned and could reflect badly on the family, and even encouraged Caitlyn to go after
Vi
when there was trouble in their relationship.
Cassandra's death in Jinx's attack on the Council greatly affected Caitlyn, and she would blame herself for failing to kill Jinx when she had the chance. The absence of her mother left Caitlyn angry and confused and would directly cause her obsession with hunting down and killing Jinx.

Tobias Kiramman
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Tobias is Caitlyn's father, and as a hunter, he likely held some role in her interest in becoming a marksman. He is very supportive of his daughter and would frequently defend her actions when
Cassandra
would express her disapproval, often playing peacemaker during their quarrels. He cares very much about Caitlyn's well-being and is there to use his medical expertise to heal her when she gets hurt on the job. Tobias was very protective of his daughter and would become angry with anyone who put her in danger, even unintentionally.
After Cassandra's death, Caitlyn and Tobias mourned her together. When Caitlyn blamed herself for failing to kill
Jinx
when she had the chance, Tobias affirmed his support for her by bestowing upon her the
Kiramman
key, reassuring her that it was her "legacy" to lead their clan in her mother's place. Tobias would later direct
Jayce
to where find he could find Caitlyn and comfort her. Tobias continued living with Caitlyn in their mansion through the martial law period, but it is unknown how he reacted to her time as commander.

Jayce Talis
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Jayce and Caitlyn have a close friendship. Since her parents had sponsored Jayce's research at the Academy, Caitlyn knew him since she was a child and would sometimes help him carry materials to his workshop. After and explosion destroyed his laboratory, Jayce was expelled for his unsanctioned experiments, which led him to be shunned by the rest of Piltover. Caitlyn was an advocate of Jayce, but her opinion mattered little, as she was still only a child. As he had brought shame upon them, Caitlyn's parents turned their backs on Jayce and forbade Caitlyn from seeing him, which seemed to upset her greatly. Nevertheless, Jayce soon won back the Kiramman's favor after proving that
hextech
was a viable and revolutionary practice.
As Caitlyn grew up, her friendship with Jayce remained intact over the years with him sometimes teasing and joking with her even while they were both busy working. After she became an enforcer, Jayce was one of the few people Caitlyn trusted enough to talk to about her investigations without being judged or ridiculed. After Caitlyn was nearly killed in one of
Jinx's
attacks, Jayce offered Caitlyn a position as one of his personal bodyguards on the Council; however, Caitlyn refused Jayce's offer, realizing he was trying pull her away from her investigation as a means to protect her. Soon after, Caitlyn forged an order from Jayce to secure
Vi's
release from prison, and Jayce covered for her by pretending he was aware of it.
When Caitlyn returned to Piltover, she was shocked that Jayce had developed a newfound prejudice towards the undercity, and quickly took note that he wasn't acting himself. Caitlyn would later feel the same hatred growing within herself after an attack from the undercity caused the death of her mother, and she would share this realization with Jayce as he tried to comfort her. Caitlyn believed that Jayce's hextech weapons wouldn't be the answer to Piltover's problems, but Jayce decided to support her anyway by fixing Vi's
gauntlets
and building Caitlyn a powerful new
hextech rifle
to use on her mission into Zaun. The two would meet again during
Ambessa's
attack on
Viktor's
commune, and despite not having seen each other for months, Jayce was quick to rush Caitlyn and her allies back to safety in Piltover. They later planned and led the defense of the Hexgate against Ambessa's forces, with Caitlyn handling Ambessa while Jayce fought Viktor. Caitlyn presumably mourned Jayce after the battle during the funeral.

Jinx
[

edit source
]


Caitlyn was one of the surviving enforcers who survived Jinx's ambush during the bicentennial Progress Day attack, after which she made it her goal to untangle
Silco's
conspiracy and recover the
hextech
gemstone Jinx had stolen. Jinx was responsible for catching Caitlyn in multiple terrorist attacks and nearly killing her several times, and also invading her home and kidnapping her right after she had finished taking a shower. Caitlyn was shown to be afraid of what Jinx was capable of, but willing to fight back against her, believing her to be a deranged lunatic who put the entire city at risk should she remain at large. However, Caitlyn's hunt for Jinx would become complicated when she learned that Jinx was actually
Vi's
long-lost younger sister,
Powder
, and despite Caitlyn believing Jinx was "too far gone," Vi still held onto hope that Powder could be saved. When Caitlyn finally had the shot to end Jinx's life, she hesitated at Vi's request. The resulting
terrorist attack
on the Piltover Council ended the life of Caitlyn's mother,
Cassandra
, and Caitlyn blamed herself for letting Jinx live.
Jinx's attack ignited a burning hatred that Caitlyn had never felt before, and after a second terrorist attack led by Silco's remaining forces, she became obsessed with capturing and ending Jinx once and for all. She led a strike team into Zaun, which included Vi, and employed brutal tactics against the remnants of Silco's empire, such as unleashing the Zaun Gray as a chemical weapon, all the while being tormented by traumatic flashes of Jinx laughing at her, causing her to instinctively shoot objects in her crosshairs. Caitlyn's behavior worried Vi, and after Caitlyn endangered the life of a
Zaunite child
for a chance to pull the trigger, Vi stopped her and claimed that she was "acting like Jinx," which caused Caitlyn to break up with her. She'd spend the next few months working with
Ambessa Medarda
to hunt Jinx down, enacting a brutal occupation of Zaun as she arrested and interrogated many of Jinx's supporters. The lack of success in her hunt made Caitlyn weary of her hatred, and at a certain point she started hating herself.
After Caitlyn rejoined Vi's side, her life was unexpectedly saved by Jinx. Jinx's appearance caught Caitlyn off-guard and briefly reignited her anger, but after the battle, Jinx turned herself in to the authorities before apologizing for killing Caitlyn's mother and asking to be executed. Caitlyn seemed to notice that Jinx had changed since their last encounter, but was unwilling to forgive her, claiming that no amount of good deeds could undo either of their crimes. However, Caitlyn seemed unwilling to pull the trigger anymore and later reduced the number of guards, which allowed Vi to free Jinx so that she could help them in the battle. Vi's faith in her sister eventually paid off after she led a Zaunite force to rescue them. After the battle, Jinx was presumed dead after seemingly sacrificing herself to save Vi, but Caitlyn appeared to have her doubts about Jinx's fate and began to investigate the Hexgate schematics and the remains of her monkey bomb.

Piltover Enforcers
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Despite being the heir of one of
Piltover's
most powerful
mercantile clans
, Caitlyn joined the Enforcers so she could finally get a glimpse of the "real world," and to solve real cases for the good of her city and its people. At first when she was a junior officer, most of the other enforcers did not understand her, treating her like a naive blueblood and making fun of her "refined" use of language. After proving herself in her investigation into the
Zaun
(which revealed a great deal of corruption within the organization), a large number of enforcers came to respect Caitlyn's acumen and determination, and she had more than enough support within the organization to declare and sustain martial law for several months. Caitlyn was one of the leaders of Piltover's defense during
Ambessa's
invasion. Though she stepped down as the city's commander, she is presumably still a part of the Enforcers.

Grayson
[

edit source
]

When Caitlyn was young, she competed against Sheriff Grayson in a shooting competition. Caitlyn won the contest but was unsatisfied, as she noticed Grayson had held her shot, leading her to believe her parents had rigged the competition by paying Grayson to let her win. Grayson revealed that she let Caitlyn win not because her parents paid her to, but simply because she felt Caitlyn deserved it. As an enforcer, Grayson explained that knowing how to handle her weapon meant being able to protect people and be of service to Piltover—and that was trophy enough for her. Grayson then asked Caitlyn, "What are you shooting for?" This interaction presumably influenced Caitlyn's decision to join the Enforcers.

Marcus
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Marcus was the corrupt Sheriff of Piltover and Caitlyn's superior officer, who was always dismissive of the Junior Officer Kiramman while redirecting her towards trivial busywork. Caitlyn always believed Marcus wasn't taking her seriously and tried to prove herself to him, not being aware that he and his enforcers were secretly working on
Silco's
payroll as an arm of his criminal empire. Because of this, Caitlyn was blindsided when Marcus betrayed her on the Bridge of Progress when he attempted to kill her and
Ekko
for trying to reveal Silco's conspiracy. Caitlyn only escaped after
Jinx
arrived and suddenly murdered Marcus and his men. Caitlyn seemed to deduce from Marcus' final words that he had been coerced into working for Silco, as his words expressed a loving concern for his daughter
Ren
, and she later informed the Council that the Sheriff had betrayed them because of "what he had to lose."

Loris
and
Steb
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Loris and Steb assisted Caitlyn in battle during
Renni's
attack at her mother's memorial, and after proving they were skilled in combat, Caitlyn chose them as part of her strike team into Zaun. After helping Caitlyn to defeat the remaining
chembarons
, and after encountering more of
Jinx's
traps, Caitlyn and
Vi
decided to send the others home for their safety. When Caitlyn returned,
Ambessa
enacted martial law and nominated Caitlyn as the city's commander. Steb appeared confused and slightly uncomfortable with Caitlyn's appointment, but nevertheless continued to serve under Caitlyn for the following months. However, Loris left the Council chamber in disgust and would instead continue his friendship with Vi in the undercity. Loris would eventually return to aid the defense of Piltover against Ambessa's army, where he would unfortunately be killed. Loris was presumably mourned by Caitlyn, Vi, and Steb, who were the only surviving members of their original squad.

Maddie Nolen
[

]


Before they had met, Maddie had heard stories of Caitlyn's adventures with
Vi
in the undercity and claimed to be a big fan of theirs. Along with the drunken
Loris
and her on-call companion
Steb
, she was later part of the group that helped Caitlyn defend the surviving Councilors during
Renni's
attack at the memorial, and having proven herself capable, she would be chosen by Caitlyn to serve on her strike team.
[
13
]
Here, Maddie worked closely with the others on her squad and helped to deduce
Jinx's
tactics after defeating the
chembarons
Chross
and
Margot
. As they closed in on Jinx, Caitlyn and Vi sent Maddie and the others home to keep them safe. When Caitlyn returned, Maddie was an enthusiastic supporter
Ambessa's
decision to appoint Caitlyn as commander, despite the reluctance of others on their squad to support martial law.
[
14
]
Months passed, and Maddie became one of Caitlyn's most frequent advisors and confidantes after she had broken up with Vi, where she would be emotionally supportive and would sometimes be wearing Caitlyn's clothes after they slept together in her mansion.
[
21
]
Maddie assisted Caitlyn in her pursuit of Jinx, during which time she sometimes floated the idea of ending martial law and restoring the Council at Ambessa's expense. In turn, Ambessa would warn Caitlyn about the dangers of "professional entanglement," referring to Maddie's increasingly frequent visits to the Kiramman mansion.
[
16
]
Even so, Caitlyn had never truly moved on from Vi and later got back together with her after the battle at
Viktor's
commune. As Ambessa's ships closed in for an invasion, Maddie suggested negotiating with the Noxians, but Caitlyn dismissed her idea and sent her from the room to speak with Vi instead, and Maddie discreetly left the door open to listen in on their conversation.
[
19
]
Maddie later showed little regret over sabotaging the Piltovan war effort at a critical moment, turning the tide in Ambessa's favor when she attacked Caitlyn from behind and saluted Ambessa as her army approached, then obeyed her order to execute Caitlyn in the middle of the square. As Caitlyn believed she was about to die, Maddie said she "appreciated her warmth," only for the bullet to be ricocheted back into her head by
Mel
.

Ekko
[
edit
|
edit source
]

After their confrontation with
Jinx
, Caitlyn and
Vi
were kidnapped by the
Firelights
and were taken to their hideout. Caitlyn initially assumed that the Firelights were going to hurt Vi during her interrogation, but was later surprised to learn that Vi and the Firelights' leader, Ekko, were childhood friends and that he was leading the Zaunite resistance against Silco's criminal empire.
After being shown around, Caitlyn came to sympathize with the Firelights and expressed her support for them, believing the Piltover Council would stop hunting them if they knew the truth about
Silco's
activities. Ekko, on the other hand, remained suspicious of Caitlyn, since she was an enforcer from Piltover, and the
hextech
gemstone she wanted them to return to them had the ability to help them defeat Silco without Piltover's help. Vi vouched for Caitlyn, however, and Caitlyn was able to convince Ekko that the cycle of violence would only continue if he kept the gemstone, and he supported their plan to expose Silco's conspiracy, on the condition that he be the one to return the gemstone to the Council.
At the Bridge of Progress, Ekko saved Caitlyn's life from Jinx and allowed her and Vi the chance to escape. Months later, Ekko would save Caitlyn again—this time alongside Jinx—during
Ambessa's
invasion of Piltover. It is unknown if Ekko's opinion of Caitlyn has changed during this time.

Ambessa Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]

After Caitlyn's mother was killed, Ambessa took Caitlyn under her wing as both an ally and a student, instating her as commander of the city's forces under martial law while promising vengeance for her mother's death. Ambessa both trained and manipulated Caitlyn, molding her in the
Noxian
principles as they practiced on Ambessa's warships, and Caitlyn would in turn allow Ambessa's presence during interrogations and relied heavily on Ambessa's warband for the city's defense. Caitlyn seemed to realize she was nothing more than a puppet for Ambessa, but was unwilling to turn down her support while
Jinx
was still at large. She would confide as much in
Maddie
, whom she was at the time in a romantic relationship with, after which Ambessa warned Caitlyn about the dangers of "professional entanglements" (and would later gloat about this warning after Maddie betrayed Caitlyn). Caitlyn would eventually turn on Ambessa to work with
Vi
instead, and would consider her a dangerous enemy not to be underestimated.
During the final battle, Caitlyn fought Ambessa alongside
Mel
. Ambessa blinded Caitlyn's left eye in the battle, but Caitlyn managed to steal Ambessa's
rookern
, removing her protection against magic and directly leading to the warlord's death.

Singed
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Caitlyn first learned about the mad doctor from her investigation of
Silco's
criminal conspiracy, as she knew
someone
had invented
shimmer
, but was unable to place who this mysterious figure was. Caitlyn would officially meet Singed in person at Stillwater Hold, where she quickly deduced he was
Warwick's
creator and the one responsible for his murderous rampage throughout the prison. Caitlyn initially believed Singed was working for
Jinx
. However, her investigation into Singed's background soon revealed he was the missing link she had been searching for all this time: Doctor Reveck, a disgraced Piltovan alchemist who was responsible for numerous unspeakable crimes. Caitlyn condemned Singed as a "monster" before threatening to shoot him, and after asking why he would commit such atrocities, the doctor showed Caitlyn to the room where he kept his daughter,
Orianna
, explaining that his life's work was to cure her death. Singed said he believed Caitlyn and his daughter would have been friends in another life, and Caitlyn's expression softened when she saw the
chemtech
pod where he was keeping her. Ultimately, she decided to spare the doctor's life, despite her reservations about him.
Caitlyn and Singed worked together briefly during
Ambessa's
hunt for Warwick, after which she would turn on
Ambessa
to join
Vi
. As they enacted their plan to rescue Warwick, Caitlyn attacked and incapacitated Singed, but did not kill him. After Ambessa's death, Singed would not be brought to justice for his crimes, and remains at large after enabling the invasion of Piltover. They would likely be enemies if they met again.
