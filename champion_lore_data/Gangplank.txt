Personality

Gangplank is a cruel pirate captain who maintains his power through fear alone. As such, he can be exceedingly brutal in his methods, even torturing members of his own crew should they step out of line. With bone-carving and mutilation, Gangplank also showcases an artistic side in his own sick and twisted way. In his quest to be feared, Gangplank often touts his own reputation to frighten people into submission. He often remarks at how many have tried (and failed) to kill him, and shows a remarkable resistance to pain when he orders a doctor to amputate his arm without a fuss. Gangplank is shown to have little remorse for his cruel behavior, killing
Miss Fortune's
mother without mercy.

Miss Fortune
managed to overthrow and 'kill' Gangplank in revenge for him murdering her mother back when she was a girl. Gangplank had only thought of
Miss Fortune
as the most persistent of bounty hunters, unaware that she is the daughter of the gunsmith he killed when she refused to hand over
the twin pistols
he had commissioned in order to spearhead his rise to Reaver King of Bilgewater.
Miss Fortune would defeat Gangplank again in
Ruined King
and had him detained in order to publicly execute him as a show of power. He would escape before his execution and entered a massive gang war against Fortune.
