Early Life
[

edit source

Kalista was born in the long-forgotten kingdom of
Camavor
, as the daughter of the heir to the Argent Throne and the niece of
Viego
. Despite being his niece, Kalista and Viego were close in age and was one of his closest friends, acting as a big sister towards him. Eventually her father passed and when her grandfather was on his deathbed, he tasked her with monitoring Viego's reign, due to him being unprepared to rule.  Kalista served him with utmost loyalty as the general of Camavor. Viego would fall in love with
Isolde
and two would soon wed. Kalista saw Isolde as a sister and enjoyed the positive influence she had on his uncle.
When Viego was targeted by an assassin sent to kill him with a poisoned blade, Kalista deflected the blade in time but accidentally caused it to graze Isolde instead. With the best medics and priests in Camavor unable to save her, a grief-stricken Viego sent Kalista, along with the captain of the Iron Order,
Hecarim
, to find a cure. While most nations were unable to give her the results she wanted, she learned of the
Blessed Isles
and was able to get the Waters of Life that could cure even the direst of ailments. But when she got back, Isolde had already succumbed to the poison. Viego, maddened by grief, saw Kalista as a traitor to the crown and got her imprisoned.

Invasion of the Blessed Isles

In the dungeons, Kalista was visited by Hecarim, who manipulated her into revealing the location of the Blessed Isles all so he could reap glory for himself. Hecarim then told Viego about the information she gave him, which led to the fleets of Camavor sailing to the capital of the Blessed Isles,
Helia
.
However, the elders of the Blessed Isles refused to let the Camavorans pass, as they believed that death was final and to cheat it would break the natural order of the world. Viego ignored their warnings and ordered Kalista to kill them. She refused and tried to get Hecarim to stand with her, but he and his knights killed her by driving their spears into her back, before killing her lover
Ledros
and all the Camavoran soldiers loyal to her. Then, they began to raid the Blessed Isles, looting their treasures and killing all of the natives they could find. But thanks to Viego's failed attempt to revive his wife, the Blessed Isles' protective barrier was tainted by the magic of Viego's
blade
, causing a disaster which turned it into the ghostly realm now known as the
Shadow Isles
.

Spirit of Vengeance
[

edit source
]

Many of the people within the Isles at the time of the Ruination, both living and dead, were reborn as ghostly
wraiths
. Kalista was one such wraith, who remembered nothing but her feelings of vengeance toward Hecarim as she died. She became a spirit of vengeance, travelling all over Runeterra to appear before those who made pacts in her name, absorbing their souls to kill the ones whom had betrayed them. But with each soul she absorbed, her humanity disappeared as she became a hive mind of vengeful souls who avenged the wronged across Runeterra.

Appearance
[

In life, Kalista was a woman with an athletic physique, brown skin, brown eyes, and long, flowing black hair. Her regal Camavoran armor was blue plate with a gold trim. She wore a cloth around the back of her legs and an open-faced helmet with a long, dark plume. She wielded a spear.
In death, Kalista is a translucent, teal spirit. She appears emaciated and hunched, with several spectral spears protruding from her torso. While her armor remains opaque, it is now black and dark brown with tattered cloth portions. Her spears, which now materialize in her hands, are jagged and spectral.

Personality
[

While being of royal blood, Kalista was surprisingly down to earth in life and had a strong sense of justice. She got along far better with the common footsoldiers in the military than the nobles trying to curry favour with her. She was also depicted as caring sister figure to a young
Viego
when he suddenly was to be crowned as king of
Camavor
and tried to be his emotional and moral support during his reign, with some help from
Isolde
.
When she became a wraith, Kalista lost much of her humanity. With only the memories of betrayals she has suffered in her life, an intense thirst for revenge persisted, becoming a vengeful spirit.

Immortality:
Being already dead, Kalista can't die again. She can only be banished and loose her material form for a while.
Spiritual Construction:
Wraiths can create solid constructs from spectral energy, such as bodies and physical objects. These constructs mainly base themselves around how they looked in life.
Transitory State:
Being ethereal beings, Wraiths can shift from the physical world and spiritual one at will. This means they can become intangible and invisible, and teleport from one place to another.
Spirit of Vengeance:
After dying, Kalista became a vengeful spirit that hunts down others that have betrayed their oaths. This grants her many terrible powers.
Pacts of Vengeance:
If someone craving vengeance call upon Kalista, she will come to their aid and grant them their vengeance, stalking her mark until they die by her spears.
Soul Absorption:
When the pact is done, the dying will be absorbed inside Kalista and became part of an endless vortex of souls inside of her.

Ruined King's
niece and was one of his generals in life. Kalista's father was the previous king of

. Viego became the king after his brother died in battle. Despite being her uncle, Kalista and Viego were around the same age and friends for a long time since he was largely ignored in favor of Kalista's father. When her father died and Viego became king, his negative traits were worsened and they began to drift apart, however she was still loyal to him. Kalista managed to protect Viego from an assassin, but resulted in Isolde getting poisoned instead. She would set sail in order to find a cure, but found it too late and was imprisoned as a traitor for her failure.She was eventually convinced by
Hecarim
to lead
Viego
and their army to the Blessed Isles for the Waters of Life. When the masters of the island refused to let them use the water, Viego ordered her to kill anyone who opposed them. Kalista refused and was stabbed by Hecarim before her forces clashed with the Iron Order.

In her journey to the Blessed Isles, Kalista crossed paths with
Ryze
during his formative years. Initially, she found the young apprentice brimming with arrogance and entitlement, reminiscent of her uncle,
Viego
. Their first encounter ended with Ryze's arm twisted, after which Ryze started to be far more respectful towards the Camavoran princess.
When hearing had Kalista sacrificed herself in order to give the people of Helia a chance to escape from the invading Camavorans, Ryze regretted not having had the opportunity to apologize for their initial meeting.
