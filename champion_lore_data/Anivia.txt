Early Life

edit source
]

Anivia is an ancient
demi-god
who represents the eternal cycle of life, death, rebirth and the changing of the seasons. She, along with her many siblings, sprung from
Runeterra
during its formation and together they began to forge the lands of the
Vorrijaard
itself. Anivia's birth in particular is believed to have brought the first winters into the world, with some even claiming she is responsible for creating
True Ice
.

Arrival of Mortal Tribes
[

When the first mortals arrived in the ancient Vorrijaard, Anivia welcomed them willingly. Witnessing their fragility to the cold weather, she sheltered and guided them to secluded valleys where they would establish their own tribal communities and harden themselves to the elements. While nurturing and watching over these tribes, the mortals would come to revere and worship her and her siblings as gods. Legends state that, though she hoped that these tribes would remain united, blood-feuds and infighting made them susceptible to a massive invasion from a greedy king in the south who marched through the mountains seeking to claim the wild magic of the Vorrijaard for himself. Anivia, angered by the outsiders, summoned a massive snowstorm that lasted a century, obliterating the ancient army.

The Three Sisters

A young mortal woman named
Lissandra
, alongside her two sisters Avarosa and Serylda, sought to harness the magics of the world and claim dominion over the entire Vorrijaard. In order to do so, each sister scoured the world for ancient powers to harness with Lissandra seeking to tame the wild magic of the land itself.

Anivia's brothers
Valhir
and
8
Ildhaurg
however grew angered by Lissandra's defiance and sought to destroy the three sisters for their transgressions. Anivia however, alongside her other siblings, was more inclined to work with the sisters rather than declare a war.
[

]
After the eldest sister Lissandra made a pact with
otherworldly masters
, these three sisters would form a mighty alliance and lead a horde of warriors called the
Iceborn
. These powerful mortals were attuned to elemental magics of the ice, capable of wielding and utilizing the True Ice substance and practically immune to the frigid cold of the Vorrijaard, now called the
Freljord
.
[

As Lissandra and her sisters gained power and marched with their armies, they slowly erased the influences of the Freljordian demi-gods in favor of venerating the Three Sisters as goddesses, affecting the worship of Anivia and her siblings over time.

Death and Rebirth
[

It's believed that even death cannot touch Anivia herself, as many stories tell of how she had been struck down a handful of times throughout history, always followed by a magnificent rebirthâ€”for as long as the Freljord exists, her soul remains immortal. Each rebirth may take hundreds or thousands of years before she rises again, but they always coincide with the dawn of a new era for the Freljord, causing her appearance to be both a wondrous blessing as well as an omen of great or terrible changes on the horizon.
Legend has it that Anivia once sacrificed herself against a march of towering
Balestriders
, colossal and ancient creatures now corrupted by the influence of Lissandra.

Though she was incapable of truly slaying these creatures, she instead plunged into the ice beneath their feet and shattered her own body, entombing them beneath the ice and snow.

Myths and Legends
[

edit source

Anivia is ancient enough to have witnessed countless mortal civilizations and is highly revered to by many tribal communities of the Freljord. Many stories and legends have been told in Anivia's honor, cementing her as a staple for most of Freljordian mythology and culture.
One of the oldest stories of Anivia tells of how her brother Ornn felled one of her favorite perching trees to build his house the Horn Hall. Annoyed by this, Anivia sought to prank her brother by tickling his nose with her feathers as he slept, causing him to sneeze out a gout of flame and setting his bedsheets on fire. Anivia, panicked by the blaze of fire building in the wooden house, flapped her wings to fly away and accidentally stoked the fire even hotter within the dry Freljordian air, causing all of Horn Hall to light ablaze. Ornn woke up on top of a pile of ashes in a bad mood, feeling disturbed in his sleep but unaware of the prank Anivia did on him, something she hasn't told him to this day.

The nomadic
Notai
highly revere Anivia, traveling along the waves of frost believed to spill from Anivia's massive wings.
[

]
Well known for their songs and storytelling, the Notai have many songs that detail Anivia's magnificent birth; bursting from a giant egg of ice and hurling tiny shards into the sky to eventually fall as snow.
Another tribe, called the Mourncrow, have sagas telling how the frigid winds and blizzards that scour the Freljord actually originate from the first beats of Anivia's wings when she first birthed into the world.
The
Avarosan
tribe have a legend about an Iceborn warmother named Ulla Shatter-Spear, who was favored by Anivia herself for saving a young
Hawk
from a
Rimefang Wolf
. Throughout Ulla's life, Anivia protected her from harm until she finally fell in battle after witnessing a hundred winters. After her death, Ulla's soul was welcomed by Anivia herself with wings spread wide.

Anivia has reemerged from her egg once more, marking the start of a new era for the Freljord and bringing great change. She most recently appeared before
Ashe
, who continued her deceased mother Grena's search for the mythical
Throne of Avarosa.
Ashe, now the new warmother of the Avarosan tribe, is seen by Anivia as the one who can finally reunite the tribes of the Freljord and thus has somewhat gained the favor of the Cryophoenix.

With Anivia's return to the Freljord, more and more shamans and spirit walkers of the old demi-gods feel her presence and the new era she heralds to the Freljord, though they are unsure of what great threat she has come to face.

The mighty Volibear, also known as
Valhir
, is the Freljordian demi-god of storms and warfare. Volibear interacted with Anivia when he called his siblings together to declare war on the ice witch
Lissandra
. Many of the gods, especially Anivia, actually denied Volibear's proposal of war and was more inclined to cooperate with the mortals.
[

Despite this, and despite his violent nature, Volibear actually highly respects Anivia as a goddess.

Lissandra
[

edit source
]

Though it's unsure whether or not Anivia has personally interacted with Lissandra, she is the one who moved to make peace with her instead of declaring war like her brother Volibear proposed. Anivia felt the ice witch's presence when she rallied her army of
Iceborn
to claim dominion over the Freljord, as followers of the old gods began to die out in her crusade to wipe out all of their worshippers.
