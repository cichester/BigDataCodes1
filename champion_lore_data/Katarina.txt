Katarina Du Couteau was born to one of the most respected families in Noxus. While her younger sister
Cassiopeia
took after their politically brilliant
mother
, Katarina studied the way of the blade under her
father's
legacy as the empire's greatest assassin. But the wily General Marcus was a harsh teacher with many pupils, and kinship held no bearing on his high expectations. Katarina spent her childhood in intense training: climbing the tallest towers after dark, handling dual blades with equal precision, and even building tolerance against various poisons used by assassins. This was her contribution to the empire, and she yearned for the opportunity to demonstrate her talents and win her honor.

One day on the western front, Katarina was tasked to assassinate an enemy line officer known as Demetrius. Seeing the mark as a waste of her talents, Katarina would instead ensure a swift victory by eliminating the enemy commander. This proved to be a terrible judgment, as Demetrius took charge of the enemy forces and killed dozens of Noxian soldiers, nearly costing the general his life. Furious with his daughter's disobedience, Marcus sent out his adoptive son and protégé: the assassin known as
Talon
. Their battle was brief but left in a draw, with a scar over her left eye that would forever remind them both of failure. Six hours later, Katarina presented Demetrius's severed head as recognition of her failure. Humbled by the consequences, Katarina knew she had lost her father's favor, but hoped to someday redeem herself in both his eyes and the empire.

Katarina: Issue 1

Four years after the coup against Emperor
Boram Darkwill
, Marcus mysteriously went missing, and the family assumed he had been killed. In support of the new regime, Katarina made certain to make her skills known to
Swain
, and rose to status as one of his most esteemed assassins. She eliminated Swain's political rivals over the years, cutting down rogue warbands and silencing those who continued to fight for Darkwill. Katarina believed that the old guard needed to make way for a brighter future, without tyrants or prejudice robbing the Noxian people of the chance to thrive.

One day, Katarina is abruptly stolen away to somewhere private. The assailant reveals himself to be her father Marcus, who had in fact faked his own death on Swain's order. He tells of his undercover work in
Demacia
, and that Swain changed the plan to give Katarina her biggest assignment yet: a covert assassination of
King Jarvan III
as well as the noble
Luxanna Crownguard
, during the chaos of
Sylas
'
Mage Rebellion
. Mistrustful of Swain, Marcus advised Katarina that the Grand General had betrayed them both and practically sent her on a suicide mission to ruin the standing of house Du Couteau. Still, Katarina decided to follow through, as her success would be undeniable merit against any potential persecution.
Upon finding Lux seized by Demacian guards, Katarina frees her and makes a short conversation. She decided against killing the young girl, sympathizing with the lady's rejection of family attitudes and the current Demacian regime. On the other hand, Jarvan III was both a tyrant and a traitor to his people, as he oppressed mages just because they had the strength to overthrow him. Katarina made way to kill the king and abscond from the surviving guards, who then pinned the assassination on Sylas. However, her escape from the city was interrupted by
Garen
, who received a tip that she was a mage helping Sylas. The two engaged in a short but fierce fight that abruptly ended after an explosion signaled the start of riots. With no time to waste, the two amicably parted ways and Katarina re-focused on trying to escape Demacia.
With the guards distracted by the uprising, Katarina hijacked a raptor rider to cross the city walls. But a rogue arrow struck and killed the rider, sending her plummeting into the forest. It is revealed that Captain Jaredan was responsible for the shot; he was part of the undercover assassination, but had secret orders to sabotage Katarina.

Confronting Family

Katarina miraculously survived the fall, but one of her daggers had shattered. She quickly retreated back to the hideout in Noxus to be nursed back to health by her friend
Drann
. She also noticed Jaredan waiting outside, and realized that circumstances may not be what she thought. Whoever wanted to kill Katarina had to be well informed of her family's secrets. With her father still out and about, she returned home to confront the only suspect.

Swain saves Katarina.

Stirring her brother out of bed, Katarina's trust grew awry when she caught the faint scent of her father's perfume, and she immediately attempted to subdue him. Talon reveals that he helped fake Marcus' death in an elaborate plan to replace Katarina and topple Swain. Before he could deal the fatal blow with Katarina's dagger, she took her broken dagger and cut his eye. After this, Katarina decides to spare Talon. As she turns to leave, she assured she never held a grudge against him for scarring her face and wished that he would break off from father's legacy towards his own path. She left the house vowing that she to kill Talon if he chose not to heed her advice.
The next morning, Katarina and Drann performed a blood-bonding ritual to link her to her new blades, enabling her to teleport to the weapons and vice versa. Intent on protecting Swain from her father, she headed towards the Immortal Bastion. When they meet, Marcus reveals that he orchestrated to sabotage Katarina's mission in Demacia, and that the true target of Swain's orders was not Lux, but himself.
A final battle ensues, shrouded in smoke and lasting for an arduous duration. In a desperate attempt to finish the job, Marcus decided to sacrifice himself by priming a devastating Wolf's Maw explosive. Katarina swiftly flew her dagger to knock the charge from his hand, and threw her blade as far as she could into the air, intending to teleport to it with the device before it could detonate. However, Swain unexpectedly intervened, seizing the explosive and redirecting the impending blast toward Marcus, instantly incinerating him. In the aftermath of the battle, Swain congratulated Katarina on her assignment, revealing it was a test to find his failsafe; the only person who could kill him if his demon would take control of him one day. Fully embracing her role as Swain's assassin, she eliminated Jaredan two months later in Northern
Freljord
.

Following the mission sent from an unsigned letter, Katarina was able to infiltrate the Silken Danse at the manor of house Kythera and located her unnamed mark. However, her initial attacks was thwarted by
Elise
and forced out of her masquerade disguise. As the two then fighted across the ballroom, Katarina was able to maneuver and eliminate her mark still. Standing triumphant over his body, Katarina smirked at Elise, who had turned into her Spider Form.

As heir to a house of assassins, Katarina had pursued her father's approval for many years, but always remained short of his standards.

She is a firm believer in individual merit, and recognizes the benefit of having allies, especially those of different skillsets. Therefore, she finds mutual appreciation under the Trifarix.
As an assassin, Katarina is an agile fighter, can quickly plan her strategies, and has a keen eye for the subtlest of clues. Behind these instincts, her personal code of conduct dictates how she would kill targets based on how honorable she regards them, also shows a somewhat flirtatious personality with Garen.

In contrast to
Cassiopeia
,
Talon
is the adopted son of Marcus Du Couteau. In youth, Talon was tasked with a mission by Katarina's father: to eliminate her. However, Katarina miraculously survived Talon's attempt, emerging from the encounter with a distinct scar across her left eye. This encounter created an unexpected bond between them, as both had failed in their respective missions.
After their encounter, he adopted a nonchalant demeanor towards Katarina, assuming the role of her composed younger brother. Behind this facade, however, he secretly conspired with his adopted father to overthrow
Jericho Swain
, who had recently ascended to power. Talon nursed a deep-seated jealousy towards Katarina, who had been entrusted with the symbolic daggers of House Du Couteau, a clear indication of the rightful heir.
Upon revealing his intentions, Katarina responded with unexpected empathy. She understood that Talon was merely a puppet, obediently carrying out her father's orders without question. The failed assassination attempt, rather than fostering animosity, prompted Katarina to reflect on her family dynamics. As she departed from Talon, she wished for him to break free from her father's control and forge his own destiny. However, with a resolute warning, she made it clear that if Talon remained shackled by her father's influence, she would be compelled to bring an end to him herself.

Katarina interacts very little with her younger sister,
Cassiopeia
, since both live in different worlds. While Katarina was taught by her father, pushing her to learn the way of the blade, Cassiopeia took after their politically brilliant mother.

Marcus Du Couteau
[

]

Katarina and her father,
Marcus Du Couteau
, had a very strained relationship. According to Marcus, her daughter always seemed to fail him as an assassin. To him, she was to brash and killed with a sense of passion and not with a cold, mercilessness he believed was necessary for an assassin. Because of this he ordered a young Talon to kill his firstborn daughter. After multiple attempts on her life failed, she confronted her father. She told the general she had considered taking his head instead, but eventually decided—as much as she hated to admit it—that he had done the right thing in ordering her death. She had failed. Not just as an assassin, or as a daughter, but as a Noxian. She knew she had lost her father’s favor, and could never regain it. He would raise others in her place, simply to spite her. Still, she vowed to redeem herself, no matter the cost—to rededicate her talents to the empire, and to become the sinister weapon she always intended to be.
After her father mysteriously disappeared in
993 AN
, she starts taking orders from
Swain
. Three years later, he reveals himself to her, saying that Swain is going to send her on a mission to
Demacia
to die. After not only completing her mission successfully but coming out of it alive, she returns to
Noxus
. Realising that her father is trying to kill Swain, she immediatly moved to stop him.
During their final confrontation, she says to her father that he always wanted her to fail, because he was afraid she would grow to be better then him.  As their battle came to a climax, Marcus tried to take both Katarina and Swain with him by using an explosive known as the "Wolf's Maw". Before it could detonate, Swain arrived to redirect the explosion to Marcus, instantly incinerating him.

Katarina remembering her encounter with
Garen

Encountering each other in the midst of the chaos during
Sylas' Mage Rebellion
in Demacia, Garen, acting on misinformation, confronts Katarina under the belief that she is aiding Sylas. After mentioning she saved his sister from capture, she suggested Garen should do the same. After some fierce clashes of steel, an explosion stops their battle. Both combantants agree that they don't have time for their scuffle. Garen and Katarina have a small moment, bonding over their shared grievances with their younger siblings. Before she leaves, Katarina says to Garen she sees a great future for Garen and his sister.
While it is unclear that Garen has any intrest in Katarina, Katarina has some intrest in him. During her bonding ritual with her weapons, she focused on a moment when she was not trying to figure out every angle, where she just felt something and connected. The moment she chose was her first encounter with Garen, smiling faintly.
