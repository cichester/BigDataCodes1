Distant Past

Sahn-Uzal
was one of the most feared warlords in the northern wildlands, conquering countless tribes and settlements so that he would one day earn a seat at the gods' table, the Hall of Bones.
[

]
Sahn-Uzal's conquests led to much bloodshed and sacrifice, and he was soon pursued by the demon
Atakhan
, who was drawn to the scent of death the warlord left in his wake. Sahn-Uzal managed to defeat the demon, but not before losing his most loyal general, Khatash-Li. Unwilling to let his best warrior die, Sahn-Uzal tasked his sorcerers to bind Khatash-Li's helmet with Atakhan, in a dark ritual that combined their souls into one tortured body and enslaved the demon to his will. Atakhan brought ever more victories to Sahn-Uzal, and his empire grew substantially.

Sahn-Uzal's conquests would one day end, however, and after his countless victories, Sahn-Uzal believed he had certainly earned a place in the Hall of Bones. But when he passed into the afterlife, he was furious to find there was no eternal glory like he had been promised as a follower of the First Truth;
[

]
only an
empty gray wasteland
where souls would go to wander and eventually fade away. Vowing to forge the kingdom he was denied, Sahn-Uzal refused to fade, fueling himself with his hatred as he learned Ochnun, the language of the dead. Eventually, he formed a plan to return to the realm of the living and began to whisper temptations to any mortal foolish enough to think they could control him.

Return from Death
[

Centuries later, Sahn-Uzal was summoned and bound into a massive suit of armor by a cult of sorcerers who sought to use the conqueror's prowess for their own ends. When they tried to bind him to their will, however, the spell failed, as Sahn-Uzal had given up his former name. His name was now only spoken in the language of the dead:
Mordekaiser
. After slaying the foolish sorcerers, Mordekaiser forged a new mace from their souls—
Nightfall
—and began his second conquest as the Iron Revenant.
Empowered by new necromantic sorcery, Mordekaiser raised the fallen soldiers from his past as shadows bound to his will, among them his old demonic servant, Atakhan.
[

]
At some point, Mordekaiser also bound a fire demon,
Tybaulk
, to his service,
[

]
and amassed a circle of acolytes who would do his bidding. Mordekaiser also captured a
yordle
,
Veigar
, and enslaved him to his service by torturing him until his mind eventually broke.
[
9
]
With an army of dark forces at his command, Mordekaiser forged an empire that lasted for generations, bringing with it untold death and destruction. At the center of his empire, Mordekaiser raised the
Immortal Bastion
, which was both a symbol of his power and also held a darker, secret purpose.
After many years, Mordekaiser's reign of terror would finally come to an end when he was betrayed by one of the acolytes from his inner circle,
LeBlanc
, who joined forces with the hemomancer
Vladimir
and conspired with the Noxii tribes to seal Mordekaiser away, seizing his fortress and demonic servants for herself. Unbeknownst to LeBlanc, her betrayal had always been a part of Mordekaiser's plan, and after his second death he found himself surrounded not by an empty wasteland but by a grand and eternal
Afterworld
, which he had constructed of blocks and mortar molded from the very souls he had slain on his second conquest. Mordekaiser called his Afterworld
"
Mitna Rachnun
"
and went to rule over the unfading souls as lord and master for all eternity.

Recent History

Mordekaiser remains in Mitna Rachnun, biding his time so that he may return once more to begin his final reign over Runeterra. LeBlanc continues to watch his armor to prevent the seal from breaking, and continuously seeks out more power to do battle against the Iron Revenant should he return one day.
[

]
Mordekaiser still has some acolytes in Runeterra, such as Januk
[

]
and
4
Lord Mallat
. His fortress, the Immortal Bastion, remains a symbol of power across the continent, eventually serving as the seat of power for the empire of
Noxus
.

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Mordekaiser appears to be a massive suit of animated armor with no visible trace of humanity save for two spectral teal eyes. Rigid and angular, the black metal plates that comprise his form are enormous, featuring three large spikes on each shoulder and two "horns" from the helmet. The armor seems to pulse and glow with the bright teal color of necromantic magic. He also wears a dark red loin cloth and a tri-pointed cape, faded and tattered.
His oversized mace,
Nightfall
, is colored identically to his armor and is spiked outward in four directions.

Personality
[

|
edit source
]

Mordekaiser is a brutal warlord that desires to conquer everything and destroy all those that stands in his way. Having died twice before, he does not fear death, as that would merely send him back to his own hellish dominion.

Abilities

Necromancy
:
After dying, Sahn-Uzal was placed inside a foggy plane of the Spirit World. There he learned Ochnun, the language of the dead, permitting him to pass through the veil. Now with the new name of
Mordekaiser
, the Iron Revenant can control spectral energy to his desires.
Self-Resurrection:
Mordekaiser is able to bind his own soul in his suit of armor, allowing him to continue in the physical world.
Soul-Bidding:
When someone is slain by Mordekaiser or one under his control, their spirits are bound to his will, becoming servants in his army, regardless of their previous alliances.
Soul Constructs:
Mordekaiser can collect the soul of his victims and twist them in to whatever shape he desires. Many of his belongings, such as his armor and his mace, are made from the souls of the dead.
Metallic Armor:
Mordekaiser often posses a enchanted armor that allows him to exist in the physical plane, and destroy his foes with overwhelming force.
Mitna Rachnun
:
By sheer force of will, Mordekaiser has been able to create his own
realm of the dead
where he and those he controls go after leaving the physical plane. This allows him a home base that no army can reach.

Relations

Atakhan
[

edit source
]

Atakhan was a demon who was drawn by
Sahn-Uzal's
bloody conquests, hoping to feed on the misery, terror, and death that followed in his wake. Atakhan eventually attacked Sahn-Uzal, but was defeated and later bound to his service when Sahn-Uzal forcibly melded the demon with his most loyal general, Khatash-Li. Atakhan served Sahn-Uzal dutifully and violently, and became known as the warlord's "Bringer of Ruin." When Sahn-Uzal eventually died, Atakhan was free to roam Runeterra once again. When Sahn-Uzal returned as
Mordekaiser
, he summoned Atakhan as a shadow from his past, gifting the demon a new form to do his bidding. However, Atakhan had grown used to its freedom and refused to serve him, so it was once again bound to its master's will by brutal force. After Mordekaiser was defeated by
LeBlanc
and
Vladimir
, they acquired Atakhan's helm and used magic to bind the demon to the service of the
Black Rose
.

LeBlanc
[

]

LeBlanc was one of Mordekaiser's acolytes during his reign as the Iron Revenant, who bore witness to his second enslavement of
Atakhan
and his brutal conquests across Valoran. LeBlanc would eventually conspire against her master and was instrumental to his downfall, which she accomplished together with
Vladimir
. Unbeknownst to LeBlanc, Mordekaiser had planned on her betrayal, suggesting he never fully trusted her to begin with. She is preparing to banish him when he returns to keep
The Immortal Bastion
for herself.

Veigar
[

edit source
]

Mordekaiser tortured Veigar and forced the
yordle
to serve him until his defeat. Mordekaiser's reign had a lasting influence on Veigar, who would continue to mimic the revenant's behavior long after his downfall.

Vladimir
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Vladimir was considered a god among the barbarian tribes in eastern Valoran, until he was approached by
LeBlanc
and recruited to her conspiracy to end Mordekaiser's dark reign. Their plan to seal Mordekaiser succeeded, and they stole the
Immortal Bastion
and Mordekaiser's demonic servants for themselves. Currently, Vladimir owns a defaced statue of Mordekaiser, which is displayed prominently in his home.
[
11
]
Mordekaiser, in turn, does not think highly of Vladimir, referring to him as a "stain splattered on the pages of history."

Tybaulk
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Prior to Mordekaiser's defeat, Tybaulk was one of his demonic servants who wreaked havoc on everything that stood in his master's way.
[

]
More recently, Tybaulk has been tamed by the will of
Annie Hastur
, so it is unknown if he still remains loyal to Mordekaiser.

Noxus
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Though his feats as Sahn-Uzal have largely faded into myth, Mordekaiser's second reign as the Iron Revenant made him a well-known and dreaded figure across Noxus, with Noxians learning about him in history books and defacing his many statues in the old city, while many fear the very mention of his name.
[

]
[
12
]
Mordekaiser's fortress, the
Immortal Bastion
, serves as the Noxian seat of power, with both the
Trifarix
and the
Black Rose
operating within the fortress walls.

Kindred
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Given Sahn-Uzal's faith in the Hall of Bones, it's safe to say his culture did not have a Kindred myth; which would explain why he was never claimed by them.

Januk
[

edit source
]

Januk
tasked
Ezreal
to obtain the
Elixir of Uloa
with which he would be able to resurrect Mordekaiser. However, Ezreal intentionally gave him a fake vial and left Januk while stealing an old Ochnun bell.

Viego
[

While it's not directly confirmed, it has been implied Mordekaiser may have a certain level of awareness about Viego's actions and is waiting to benefit from them once he decides to return.
[

It has been confirmed if they were to directly fight, Mordekaiser would likely win.
