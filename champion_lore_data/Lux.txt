Lux was born in Demacia in Silvermere into the Crownguard family, one of the richest and most powerful families in the kingdom, after Garen joined the Demacian army, Lux was groomed to be an obedient and helpful person to the Crownguard family and the royal family, but she was quite a rebellious girl who wanted to explore the world and what was outside the walls of Demacia.
One night Lux was riding back home after a long exploration, but at that moment a pack of wolves ambushed her and her horse with the intention of eating her, when they were about to attack her, Lux, full of fear, unleashed a powerful blast of light from her hand, horrified, Lux realized that she was a mage, the terror of the Demacians and her family, since then she did everything she could to hide her powers for fear of being locked up and murdered.

Contemporary history

For the next few years, Lux tried to hide her magical powers, afraid of what would happen. Thinking that she would turn bad or that her family would fall into disgrace. She spent sleepless nights trying to suppress her powers but then began to familiarize herself with magic, practicing and experimenting in secret; bending the solar rays of the gardens making them take different solid forms or making sparkles dance between her fingers. Lux decided that she will keep her powers a secret as long as possible.
When she turned 16, Lux was taken to Demacia by her parents to see Garen's ascension in the army. Lux began to study the laws so that over time the world would stop hating magicians like her.

Meeting Sylas

Lux stayed with Garen in Demacia and over time helped him maintain order in the city, however one day Garen chased a mage girl who was escaping, Garen managed to immobilize her and arrest her which made Lux very uncomfortable. Lux discovered that the woman had a spell book which she used to practice her magic, realizing the number of confiscated magic books, she decided to use her family influence to enter the place where all those books were to investigate if anyone could help to control their powers.
After not having found anything useful, she decided to take a walk around the place, where she found an entrance she did not know, two guards tried to stop her but she said it was a Crownguard and they let her pass, accompanied by a guard she discovered that it is the place where they lock up mages. She felt quite surprised and at the same time somewhat horrified to learn that she would be sent there if she was discovered but she went ahead and saw that all the mages were forced to drink a liquid which weakens their powers.
Lux asked why they didn't just exile them, but the guard responded by telling her that sometimes exile wasn't enough punishment. As they walked, Lux saw a large door that caught her attention. The guard told him not to enter since
Sylas of Dregbourne
was there, one of the most dangerous criminals in Demacia.

After her powers were discovered, Lux was forced to flee Demacia, but not wanting to go with Sylas, she founded her own mage's refuge in which she would shelter mages who did not want to get involved in the civil war.

Appearance

Lux is a tall, pale-skinned young woman with big blue eyes and shoulder-length large golden blonde hair, on top of which she always wears a dark blue headband.
While she generally wears typical demacian noble attire in public, she is primarily seen in armor with a silver-white breastplate and skirt, dark blue leggings covering her legs and arms, white heeled boots to match her skirt and breastplate.
When Lux uses her magic, her eyes can sometimes change from blue to bright gold.

Personality

Lux presents an energetic and optimistic disposition, being happy and finding humor all the time. However, in more serious situations, Lux's facade drops and she turns out to be constrained and worried about her magic and being found out. She wishes for mages to be accepted in Demacia and opposes the Mageseekers' prosecution of them just because of their powers, sympathizing with Sylas for being unfairly imprisoned. When he betrayed her and started the rebellion, Lux saw him as the danger he truly was, though since the rebellion she has decided to help innocent mages secretly escape Demacia and founded a refuge to offer shelter to those refusing to join the Sylas camp.

Family

Lux is the youngest in noble family Crownguard, born with magical abilities she keeps hidden for fear of being executed or exiled from
Demacia
. Lux feared of what could happen if her older brother
Garen
found out about her powers (their uncle was killed by a mage, an event that made Garen show magic users both zero tolerance and no mercy). She believed their mother was the only one who knew, however, she had no idea that Garen and their aunt
Tianna
had realized that she was a mage several years earlier, and were thinking of ways to protect her. Although they are aware of her power, they were somewhat in denial of Lux being a mage herself. After the events of the
Lux comic
, Lux got Garen to verbally acknowledge that she was a mage. The two parted ways on good terms.
Garen and Luxanna's father, Pieter Crownguard, was a defender during the failed Noxian assault nicknamed
Cyrus's Folly
. This is likely referring to the same Cyrus who conquered the port city Basilich, which also happens to be the hometown of
Darius
and
Draven
.

Galio
[

Galio deems Lux 'the only mage he likes' and the one that can help him attain prolonged animation periods longer than a single battle. Lux was apparently the first person to have a conversation with Galio when she was 13-years-old, but he first became aware of her when her family made a pilgrimage to see him when she was a toddler. During the events of
Warriors
, Lux would make an appearance during Sylas' attack with the
Winter's Claw
on a northern fortress, which Garen and his soldiers had retreated to. When things were going badly for the Demacians, she openly reveals her magical power to call for Galio's help, which rallied Garen and his men.

Lux
was intended to marry
Jarvan IV
Lightshield as suggested by her brother
