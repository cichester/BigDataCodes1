Early life in
Koyehn
[

Born into a legacy, Hwei was destined to inherit the Temple of
Koyehn
. He spent his childhood immersed in the vibrant surroundings, translating his wild daydreams onto canvas. From a young age, it was evident that his visions were not mere reflections of reality; instead, they were fantastical interpretations that turned life itself into art.
Hwei's unique connection with the world manifested not only in his paintings but also in the shifting hues of his eyes, mirroring the ebb and flow of his mind and mood. The temple's art form, paint magic, became Hwei's chosen medium, a medium that influenced the emotions of its audience. However, strict control and discipline were necessary to prevent the art from overpowering mental perceptions and bodily sensations, as those who failed to control it were banished from Koyehn.
Despite the strict precepts, Hwei, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to explore the depths of his power, indulged his imagination. In a pivotal moment, during a demonstration for the temple masters, Hwei's control wavered as he painted Koyehn's sea. Emotions crashed over him, and he surrendered to the beauty of his creation. This awakening infuriated the temple masters who, while unwilling to exile the heir, stressed the weight of his responsibilities. Hwei, haunted yet fascinated by the depths of his power, continued to push the boundaries in secret at night.

Encounter with
Jhin

The tranquil existence of Koyehn was disrupted when
Khada Jhin
visited the temple. A bond formed between Hwei and Jhin, as they exchanged creative perspectives. However, the night before Jhin departed, he challenged Hwei, sensing the façade in the pieces he presented to the world. Reluctantly, Hwei unleashed his true art, revealing decades of suppressed emotions and imagination. Jhin, witnessing the forbidden visions, departed with an ominous farewell, stating he would move on tomorrow "to watch the lotuses bloom."
At dawn, Hwei awoke to a series of tragedies. Four historic paintings lay destroyed, the four masters who berated Hwei in his youth lay dead, and the temple itself erupted in flames. In the chaos, Hwei recognized the dark potential of his art for destruction and torment, realizing the horror and fascination that had gripped him in his youth.
As the temple collapsed into ruins, Hwei emerged as the sole survivor, haunted by guilt and the overwhelming power of his own imagination. By day, he mourned with the villagers, but by night, he revisited the wreckage, using his paintbrush and palette to create scenes that captured the essence of Koyehn's crest—the same crest worn over his heart.
Discovering a
lotus-shaped trap
amid the rubble, Hwei pieced together the perpetrator was none other than the artist he grew so close to. The thought unleashed a cascade of emotions—fear, sorrow, betrayal, and awe. Faced with a choice between staying with his people or pursuing the answers to the tragedy, Hwei, bearing only his paintbrush and palette, left Koyehn behind.
In the time since, Hwei has embarked on a journey of self-discovery and redemption. He seeks answers by revealing the full extent of his art, tracking down nefarious individuals in the darkest corners of
Ionia
. As he spirals deeper into the shadows, Hwei lights a path, his mind brimming with possibility.
