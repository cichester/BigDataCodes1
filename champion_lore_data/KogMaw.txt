Kog'Maw was created by the
same entity
that corrupted
Malzahar
, being spit out from
The Void
in Shurima. He spent most of his first days on
Runeterra
exploring and devouring most things that he saw. He is slowly being drawn towards Malzahar; the purpose of this pull and what will happen when the two meet are both unknown.

Kog'Maw is a curious creature with baseline instincts and seems to have no personality or consciousness beyond that. It is not known to what extent Kog'Maw is able to understand himself or his surroundings, however he is aware of his creator and the destruction that'll come along with the void. Kog'maw is mostly driven by an insatiable hunger and most of his thoughts revolve around food.

Voidborn
:
Kog'Maw is a voidborn, a being coming from the void to enter the material realm. Because the Void posses different laws of reality, voidborn have to create new bodies from the matter of Runeterra.
Eternal Hunger:
Kog'maw is constantly hungry, to satisfy his hunger, he can eat anything in existence.
Acid:
Kogmaw can shoot out acid from his stomach. This acid can completely disintegrate any living organism very quickly, which leaves Kog'Maw eternally hungry.
