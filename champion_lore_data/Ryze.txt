Early life
[

]

Born in Noxii territories which would later become
Noxus
, in the village of
Khom
, Ryze was a young mage apprentice to
Tyrus
of
Helia
, a member of a order tasked with gathering and protecting the most dangerous artifacts of
Runeterra
.
As time passed, Ryze would sometimes overhear Tyrus discussing something known as a
World Rune
, a collection of shards that held unbelievable power, but would hush himself if Tyrus ever spotted Ryze listening in. Though Tyrus tried his best to keep it hidden, word eventually got out about the World Runes and paranoia started to spread throughout Runeterra over how these World Runes could be used as weapons. Tyrus and Ryze traveled around
Valoran
trying to calm people down but the situation only grew more dire. Eventually though, the first shot was fired in what would later be known as the
Rune Wars
, in Noxii, Ryze's old home. Tyrus and Ryze tried and failed to hold a parley in Khom, but had no choice but to flee to the hills and when they looked back to Khom, nothing remained of Ryze's birthplace but a giant hole.
War raged across Runeterra, Ryze wanted to pick a side and help but Tyrus stopped him, Tyrus wanted to guide the world back towards peace, not bring it further into ruin. But the Rune Wars kept going, and Tyrus grew more and more distant. Eventually it got to a point where Ryze had to confront Tyrus, where he noticed Tyrus had come into possession of two World Runes. A big argument ensued, Tyrus argued that he needed the World Runes to stop the people, that there was no other way to stop the war. Ryze no longer saw Tyrus as his mentor, he was now just another man fallen to the temptation of the World Runes, and so Ryze mustered all the magic he was able to and
2
killed him
.
Soon after, the Rune Wars ended, with the greatest civilizations all but having destroyed each other. Ryze realized that as long as any World Runes were unsecured, this could happen again. He decided then that he alone would take on the burden of gathering all the World Runes and storing them away for good, vowing never to fall into temptation like his old master Tyrus.

Recent events

A battle raged in
Shurima
, between the
darkin
Aatrox
and
Xolaani
, one which threatened to end all of Runeterra. As Ryze traveled, a
3
winged being
appeared from the skies with a plea for help, Ryze recognized the messenger and realised it could only have come from
Kayle
herself. Kayle's mother and the Aspect of Justice,
Mihira
, had descended from the heavens to join the fight, but had fallen to Xolaani and been
7
absorbed
. As Ryze arrived at the battle, Kayle explained that Ryze alone had the power to stop the battle, by using the World Runes. Ryze hesitated, unsure whether it was right for him to act; and with the World Runes no less. Ryze meditated on the history of Runeterra and ultimately came to the conclusion that Runeterra was worthy to be saved, and activated the World Runes, defeating Aatrox and Xolaani.

Appearance

Ryze is a old man with violet skin due to prolonged contact with the World Runes. His body is full of tattoos in runic styles. He is bald but has a scrappy black beard, tied together at the end with a hair ring. Ryze is shirtless except for a a leather shoulder guard with a sash holding it together. A giant scroll is attached to his back, held there by the leather sash. He wears fairly simple, loose, dark blue pants with high leather boots. Around his waist he wears a leather belt with a book tied to it.

Personality
[

Ryze has become tired, longing for the day when all of this is over. Always in a hurry to get anything done as fast as possible. He tends to come across as quite rude, though argues its because he has better things to be doing. Though he is tired, he is steadfast in his goal and will get it done no matter what cost, even if that cost is the life of his friend or the death of a village. Their deaths are nothing compared to what the World Runes could bring.  Ryze has a strong control over his emotions, though he often gets mad, he never loses himself in an emotion. The only emotion he cannot control is hope, an emotion he tries desperately to get rid off, but always manages to influence him.

Kegan Rodhe, as he was known before he became Brand, was previously Ryze's apprentice, saved by Ryze from freezing to death in the harsh
Freljordian
cold. Ryze saw potential in Kegan and attempted to teach him to control his latent magical abilities. Kegan and Ryze both often became frustrated with eachother, but still held compassion for each other.
Though as Ryze neared the true goal of his journey, to one of the World Runes, Kegan fell to the temptation of the World Rune and Ryze was too late to stop him. Kegan's body and soul was burned away by the World Rune's power and what was left was the entity known as Brand. Brand now hunts down further World Runes and is constantly at odds with Ryze on his mission. Eventually, Ryze and Brand would meet in Shurima in the
City of Gardens
, in search of another World Rune, where Ryze would trap Brand beneath the sands, where he remains for now.

In her journey to the Blessed Isles,
Kalista
crossed paths with Ryze during his formative years. Initially, she found the young apprentice brimming with arrogance and entitlement, reminiscent of her uncle,
Viego
. Their first encounter ended with Ryze's arm twisted, after which Ryze started to be far more respectful towards the Camavoran princess.
When hearing had Kalista sacrificed herself in order to give the people of Helia a chance to escape from the invading Camavorans, Ryze regretted not having had the opportunity to apologize for their initial meeting.
