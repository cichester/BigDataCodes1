Early life
[

edit source

Kassadin began his life as nothing more than a lowly orphan, hired as bait for the merchant caravans of
the Great Sai
to distract the predators of the lands away from the more important goods they transported. But to the surprise of many, Kassadin survived every predator attack and instead of being hired as bait, he started being hired as a guide.
He spent many years exploring ancient ruins and guiding his employers through the Great Sai, and it was here finally gained his name;
“Kas sai a dyn?”
or “whom does the desert know?”, often shortened to Kassadin due to his employers inexperience in the language of
Shurima
. It was through this line of work where he wandered into
Zirima
where he fell in love. Kassadin and his new wife decided to settle down, south in the rocky canyons, and the two of them had a
daughter
.
Though he had a wife and daughter, work still required him to travel very far away, always bringing exciting tales back with him. One day though, on his way home from
Piltover
, he spotted some terrified, fleeing survivors speaking of a terror that ruined their homes,
the maw of the underworld
that opened up to devour everything. Kassadin hurried home as fast as his mount could travel, but when he arrived there was nothing left but rubble and ash.

The Prophet

After the death of his wife and daughter, and the total ruin of his home, Kassadin fell into a deep depression, spending years drowning his sorrows in Zirima. That was until he heard of some new unspeakable horror bellow the earth and sacrifices being made in its name, by an unholy
prophet
. He knew what happened to
Icathia
and he could not let such utter devestation happen to the rest of Shurima.
He made a vow to himself and his dead wife and child to avenge their deaths by destroying this prophet beckoning the void. Kassadin is well traveled and knows he needs to be as well equiped as possible, so he set off on one last journey to arm himself with the most arcane and esoteric equipment from all over
Valoran
. He equipped himself with
Zaunite
tech, got blessed by
Ionian
spirit-healers then lastly stole the
Nether Blade of Horok
, the bladed gauntlet of the first
Ascended
to fight against the void. His last stop now was Icathia where he would have his vengeance, no matter what.

Now Kassadin wanders what was formerly Icathia, killing anything the
Void
throws at him, his flesh, mind and spirit slowly corrupting from the dangerous artifacts he carries and from the corrupting nature of the Void, but his resolve unshaking.

Appearance

Kassadin's body has been heavily modified . His skin has turned a sickly shade of blue, if that even is his skin anymore. On his head he wears a Zaunite helmet made in a deep metal with purple embellishments and with two large metal horns on either side. The helmet itself resembles a gas mask with two metal tubes that go from the helmet to Kassadin's back. He wears two large spiked shoulder pads in the same metal and with the same embellishments as his helmet, he also wears two metal gauntlets in the same style. Other than that he is shirtless, exposing his blue skin. And to cover his lower body he wears a dark purple skirt which reaches down and covers his feet. On his right arm he wields the
Nether Blade of Horok
.

Personality
[

Kassadin has become a cold and nihilistic man. He is fixated on delivering justice, but equally wishes for the monsters of the void to strike him down so he may join his wife and child. Either way, he will defy the Void until the very end.

Kassadin and
Malzahar
are polar opposites. While Kassadin tries to fight the
Void
, Malzahar tries to bring it to Runeterra, therefore Kassadin has sworn to kill him.

Void
.
