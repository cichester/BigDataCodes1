Family History

Before Milio was born, his grandmother Lupé and her twin sister Luné both strove to join the Yun Tal through passing the Vidallion's trials, with Lupé being a master of earth while Luné mastered fire. However, Luné was caught plotting treason against the Yun Tal and imprisoned while Lupé and her family faced punishment by proxy of Lupé being her twin. Exiled to the furthest reaches of
Ixtal
, Lupé and her family lived in a faraway village that would eventually become Milio's birthplace.

Childhood
[

As Milio came of age, Lupé started to teach him how to master the elemental axiomata. Unlike the rest of the family, Milio showed great potential as a prodigy of elemental magic but struggled to understand the discipline that came with it. Disappointed, Lupé eventually gave up on Milio's teachings but he still trained his own abilities in private. Abandoning the rigid restrictions of the teachings of his grandmother, Milio eventually learned how to control fire, the only element Lupé avoided out of spite against her twin sister. However, Milio began to question the capabilities of the fire axiom and instead believed it had potential for more positive effects rather than destructive ones.
One night, Milio was chasing a group of fireflies when he noticed a village huntress who was left badly injured and unable to move. Milio rushed to help her by keeping her stable with his fire axiom, but it wasn't enough. Knowing that the healer would've been too far away to arrive on time, Milio tried as hard as he could to shape his powers into a force that could heal. Milio felt the huntress'
inner flame
, a feeling of warmth which he began to sense in the nature all around him. Focusing all of his concentration on that warm and cozy feeling, Milio manifested his fire magic into a small fire elemental which was able to heal the huntress' wounds.
Having discovered a new axiom which he named "soothing flames," Milio went home to tell his family about what he had done and showed off his new ability to summon his signature fire elementals, dubbed "
fuemigos
". While his family celebrated, Lupé was astonished by Milio's success in mastering the fire axiom despite going against the traditional teachings and discovering an entirely new axiom. Seeing his potential to undo the burdens placed on the family by her sister Luné, Lupé dedicated herself to teaching her grandson how to master his newfound abilities, preparing him for a journey to
Ixaocan
in order to restore the family's honor. Though he was nervous to endure the long trip by himself, Milio was motivated purely by the love he had for his family. For his journey, he and Lupé fashioned a backpack to store his fuemigos which he dubbed his "furnasita" and got a new set of clothes made by his family members. At the age of 12, Milio left his village and began his journey to Ixaocan, travelling across Ixtal while sending letters to his family about his adventures.

Milio travelled through the jungle when he noticed a young cougar who was injured. Wanting to help, Milio used his fuemigos to heal the cougar and the cat repaid him with affection. They both took a nap under a sun spot until they were found by
Nidalee
, the fearsome
Kashdaji Queen
as told in scary stories across Ixtal. The young cougar was revealed to be a pakaa and a member of her pack. While initially distrustful towards Milio for being a human, Nidalee began to warm up to him and allowed him travel with the pack for a short while, befriending Nidalee and her pack. Milio eventually left for a nearby village having a bonfire in order to continue his adventure, but hoped to see Nidalee again someday.
At the village, Milio found a lot of hurt people and, using his soothing fire powers, tried healing as many as he can. Unfortunately, Milio was unable to heal everyone and a few villagers were too injured to be saved. Luckily, Milio was able to make their final moments warm and comforting. Despite being able to save lots of people with his powers, Milio began to become discouraged due to the villagers he lost and continued his journey. Throughout his journey, Milio encountered many other sights while hopping around many villages on the pathway to Ixaocan. At one point, he encountered a
lady made of plants
who Milio heard rumors of in a nearby village as well as a
giant moving rock
. Eventually, a shapeshifting
vastaya
named
Neeko
smelled the scent of the pakaa on Milio and, becoming curious, attempted to play a prank on him by shapeshifting as Milio himself. Milio eventually befriended Neeko, learning about her tribe and language before continuing on his journey. Throughout his travels, Milio became a legend amongst the Ixtali as "the boy with the soothing flames."

Finally making it to Ixaocan, Milio explored the wondrous capital city of Ixtal, amazed by the many sights. However, Milio has begun to notice that people are staring at him; spying on him. Unbeknowst to him, stories about his adventures caught the intrigue of his grandaunt Luné, who has been incarcerated deep below the city all this time without his family's knowledge. Despite all this, Milio eagerly began his training so that he may one day face the Vidalion and hopefully restore the honor of his family.



Appearance

Milio is a prepubescent Ixtali boy with tan skin, amber eyes and curly black hair. He wears a red Ixtali poncho made by his family with shoulder guards. On his back, he wears his signature furnasita; a white cone-shaped knapsack with highlights made of green jewels. His furnasita holds a large fuemigo; a round fire elemental with ring-shaped eyes and a crest on its forehead.

Personality
[

Milio is incredibly compassionate and caring for others, using his abilities to heal and soothe wounds and expresses deep remorse when he's unable to save people. He cares deeply for others and has been capable of befriending lots of people on his journey to Ixaocan. However, he cares the absolute most for his family; his driving force for his whole journey in the first place. Though he has been at odds with his grandmother Lupé at times, especially during his training, he wishes to fulfill her wishes and regain honor to his family even if he seems content with how his family is living currently.

Though a natural prodigy of elemental magic, he lacks the rigid discipline that Ixtali practitioners of magic typically have as he struggles to grasp the rules of his grandmother's training.
Milio is very playful and kind when he speaks to others. He is very forward thinking and focused on his journey to one day best the Vidalion, speaking on how he wants to grow big and strong one day once he grows up and trains his magic enough. Because of his dedication and love for his family, he often mentions and talks about them a lot, especially his parents and his grandmother Lupé.

Abilities
[

edit source
]

Mage
: Milio was born with elemental magic abilities, which could grow once he comes of age and trains his abilities further. He was trained by his grandmother in the Ixtali traditions but found it difficult in following its rigid rules. Despite this, he decided to train by himself and developed his own style and understanding of elemental magic.
Fire Axiom
: Milio is a prodigy in the fire axiom and has learned to master the element of fire. Because his grandmother avoided teaching him the fire axiom out of spite against her twin sister, he's completely self taught and uses the axiom in his own unorthodox way.
Soothing Flames:
Millio has developed an entirely new axiom of his own called
"soothing flames"
, utilizing fire as a source of healing instead of destruction. By connecting himself with the 'inner flame' of living beings he can heal their injuries, offering a sense of comfort and warmth to many people at a time.
Fuemigo Summoning:
Milio's fire magic manifests as round little fire elementals he calls 'fuemigos.' As manifestations of Milio's 'soothing flames' axiom, they are capable of healing wounds and soothing pain with their warmth. Though mostly used for healing, the fuemigos are solid and bouncy, capable of being bounced around like fire balls by Milio.

Relations

Milio has a great bond with all of his family members, ranging from his parents to his siblings as well as his many cousins, all of whom he grew up with in his home village outside of Ixaocan. They celebrated his accomplishment after he discovered an entirely new axiom when healing the wounded huntress. They made him the clothes that he would wear on his journey and continuously praise and encourage him.
Milio speaks about his family very often, speaking highly of them and describing his extremely close and friendly relationship with each of them. He has seemingly befriended almost every member of his family, all of whom act as his driving force and motivate him to continue his journey. During his travels, he exchanged letters with his family to keep in touch with them, inquiring with them about their lives while he was away and often stating how he misses them and wants to make them proud.

Lupé
[

Lupé is Milio's grandmother and the one who initially tried training him in his elemental magic. Though she noticed his natural affinity for magic, Lupé actually stopped training Milio as he couldn't follow the traditional disciplines of the axiomata. Once Milio showed promise in the fire axiom, which she actively refused to teach him out of spite against her sister Luné, Lupé put her grudge aside and saw the potential in her grandson. Lupé helped prepare Milio for his journey to Ixaocan in order to showcase his natural abilities and restore honor to her family, creating his signature 'furnasita' and resuming his training.
Milio very dearly loves his grandma, or 'omele,' and is strictly motivated in making her proud once he restores the family honor. He often mentions her on his travels, stating how proud she'd be to see him now. On top of that, he speaks very highly of his omele, describing her as very strong and similar in personality to
Nidalee
, the fearsome Kashdaji queen he met on his travels.

Lupé is almost entirely focused on Milio's potential to restore the family's honor at Ixaocan, perhaps even disregarding her own family's feelings about it.

Luné
[

edit source
]

Luné was imprisoned beneath Ixaocan before Milio was born, meaning she never got to meet her grand-nephew in person. However, after he gained fame across Ixtal as the 'boy with the soothing flames', she caught word of the stories about him and recently found out he made it into Ixaocan after his long journey.

Fuemigos
[

edit source
]

Milio's fuemigos serve as his main companions, as they are literal manifestations of his fire magic come to life. He carries a large one within his furnasita and often deploys smaller ones to heal and soothe wounds with their warmth.
Milio considers his fuemigos as his best friends and, despite their inability to verbally communicate, ventriloquizes the fuemigos with a higher-pitched voice to reinforce his own thoughts.

Nidalee
[

edit source
]

Milio used to hear stories of Nidalee as a frightening creature to be feared named the Kashdaji queen, but met her in person during his journey to Ixaocan after he healed one of her pakaa. While initially distrustful towards him at first due to his human nature, Nidalee grew a fondness for the boy and allowed him to travel with her pack for a while to the next village. She calls Milio her 'fire bug' and considers him an honorary pakaa. Milio left the pack on friendly terms with Nidalee, noting that she appears as extremely harsh and fearsome on the outside but was capable of seeing the genuine softness underneath her tough exterior.

Zyra

Milio encountered Zyra on his travels, having initially heard stories about her in a nearby village and thinking of them as nothing but scary stories to tell to children. Though he saw Zyra from a distance, he immediately noticed how dangerous her plants looked and knew not to greet her and endanger himself. However, he notes in his letter to his parents that, despite her frightening appearance, he wishes he could say hi and befriend her.

Malphite

Milio encountered Malphite on his travels, initially noticing the large mountain in his way despite it being nowhere on the map. Milio investigated the strange appearance of a new mountain and discovered Malphite's face and saw him begin to move. He didn't directly greet Malphite however, despite seeing him as extremely friendly, as he didn't wanna risk being stepped on.

Neeko

]

Neeko noticed Milio because of the scent of the pakaa on his clothes, as he traveled with Nidalee's pack temporarily before leaving. Because Neeko was very close with Nidalee, she wanted to investigate and shapeshifted into Milio as a prank, amusing the boy and sparking their friendship. As the two traveled for a bit, Neeko shared lots of details about her language as well as her tribe that she's slowly creating, offering a home to any people in the jungle without one.
Milio considers Neeko a new best friend and notes that he wishes he could help her on her mission to create a new tribe but prioritizes traveling to Ixaocan to restore his family's honor instead, wishing her farewell.
