Early Life

Olaf grew up in the
Freljord
in the region of
Lokfar
, where battle and death was common and happened frequently. Olaf was a warrior and would often boast about the many battles he fought and won. However, his demeanor and lack of hesitation to share his many stories would anger and annoy some in his tribe.

A Warrior's Death
[

After boasting one night about one of his many battles, Olaf was confronted by an elder warrior who told him to prove his worth and see what his future held for him, how he would die, whether in battle or peacefully of old age. Olaf accepted and was angered when his fortune told of a long life and peaceful death. Determined to achieve a warrior's death, Olaf traveled to battle a revered
frost serpent
who had slain thousands. However, the battle ended with the serpent slain and Olaf alive.
Olaf tried to find a warrior's death against many creatures, but when he became enraged, nothing could hurt or stop him, and he found that he was able to defeat every single beast that he challenged. During his pursuits, he even tried to battle the ghost of a Krakenwyrm during a
Harrowing
at
Bilgewater
. However,
this endeavor
only ended with the Krekenwyrm slain twice.
Resolving that no mere beast could beat him, Olaf decided to take on the
Winter's Claw
, the most fearsome tribe in the Freljord. He battled and defeated their most fearsome warriors before battling
Sejuani
herself. Their battle shook glaciers with its intensity until they reached a deadlock. Sejuani stared into Olaf's soul with such intensity that his frenzy was quelled long enough for her to offer him a place in her tribe and the warrior's death he had always hoped for.
