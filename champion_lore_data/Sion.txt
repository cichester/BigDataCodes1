Background

In life, Sion was the last of a proud warrior culture that defined early
Noxus
. He made his name as the
Hand of Noxus
, an unstoppable general in the campaign for the empire's outward expansion. Finally, he met his end in a battle with King Jarvan I of
Demacia
, with both men killing each other.
Half a century later, Sion was reanimated by hemomancers of the
Black Rose
. Dark magic empowered his body but clouded his mind, turning him into an unstoppable killing machine, feared all the more by the enemies of Noxus. Now, he remains locked away in the tomb beneath a statue of himself, always ready to be deployed when the Grand General sees fit.

Appearance

Sion was already a brutishly large man in life, but in undeath, he is a towering behemoth. His scarred, gray, hairless skin is held together with dark metal plates. He has glowing red eyes and a similarly glowing furnace of dark magic in his gut. The crown of Jarvan I serves as his jaw, and a dagger protruding from the back of his skull resembles a pony tail, with a long, red ribbon flowing from the hilt.
Sion wears heavy metal plates and tattered leather armor. He has one pauldron and one gauntlet on his left side, an enormous metal belt with brown pants leading to a metal boot on the right foot and a metal peg leg on the left.
He carries a massive two-handed ax, dull and worn.

Personality

In life, Sion was a feared warrior, known not for strategic wit but for ruthless effectiveness. Always pressing forward, he swore oaths to his ancestors to never take a backwards step in battle.
After his reanimation, Sion became a creature of pure rage and bloodlust. His mind broken, he remembers only fragments of his past life. Now, all knows is that he is a vessel of death and destruction, showing no discernment between friend and foe.
