Stories about Amumu have circulated around
Shuriman
culture for centuries but his true origins are an enigma and the subject of debate. Shurimans have told countless origin stories about Amumu but the validity of these tales is uncertain as nobody can agree on a single story. Some people claim that Amumu was a young
undead
prince while others claim he's a wandering
spirit
, but the most likely explanation is that Amumu is actually a
Yordle
who has embedded himself into Shuriman culture, though even this isn't wholly agreed on.
Because Amumu has been a staple figure in Shuriman culture since ancient times, there are countless different stories that mention him throughout history. These stories vary in many ways but one detail is universally seen throughout all of them; Amumu is a mummy cursed with eternal loneliness due to his
deadly touch
and forced to eternally wander the desert in search of a friend.

Legend of the Emperor's Blight

One of the legends about Amumu connected him to the first ruling family of Shurima, claiming that they were struck by a terrible disease that forced Amumu to quarantine in his chambers. Hearing Amumu's weeping through the walls, a servant girl would often visit Amumu and eventually befriended him, bringing courtly news and tales about her mystic grandmother.
One day, the girl brought news that Amumu's eldest brother had died from the illness, making Amumu the official emperor of Shurima. Pitying him for enduring this news alone, the servant girl decided to go into his chambers and comfort him. As Amumu embraced his friend, he realized that his touch had infected her with the same blight that killed his entire family, causing her to die. On the day of her death, the girl's grandmother became enraged and placed a terrible curse on the young emperor, trapping him in a permanent moment of suffering for eternity.

The Eye of Angor

Another tale depicted Amumu as a young and cruel emperor who forced his subjects to worship him like a god. The young emperor sought the legendary Eye of Angor, an artifact believed to grant eternal life whoever gazes at it with an unflinching heart. For years Amumu hunted for the relic, being carried by a host of slaves through dangerous catacombs as they were forced to sacrifice themselves to deadly traps under Amumu's command.
When Amumu, borne by his slaves, finally reached the room containing the Eye of Angor, the emperor immediately rushed in to gaze at the artifact. Seizing their opportunity, the slaves escaped and sealed the doorway, trapping the child emperor in darkness. The young Amumu endured darkness for years to the point of insanity as he clawed at his own skin, covering the wounds with bandages. Amumu's life was extended by the Eye of Angor, allowing him to reflect on his past transgressions, but was cursed with eternal loneliness in the process.
After a series of earthquakes shattered the tomb's foundations and opened its doors, Amumu emerged, now completely wrapped in bandages and seeking redemption for the suffering he caused as emperor.

The Yordle Beggar

One of the most peculiar stories of Amumu claim that he was the first and last
Yordle
ruler of Shurima. Amumu, being a firm believer in the goodness of the human heart, sought to prove his point and swore an oath to live as a beggar until he made one true friend, convinced that his people would rally to help him. Despite thousands passing him by however, nobody extended a helping hand to the impoverished Amumu as he eventually died of a broken heart. Some say that the Yordle did not truly die however, believing that he continues to wander the desert for eternity, hoping to find someone who can restore his faith in humanity.

Modern History

The legends of Amumu still endure in modern Shurima, even after the
death of the last emperor
Azir
. It's widely believed that Amumu still wanders the desert as his cries echo through the winds while he despairs over his inability to find friendship. Some claim that they have actually encountered the mummy, stating that his very presence brings death and illness at the touch. A song known throughout
Valoran
as
The Curse of the Sad Mummy
details Amumu's loneliness as he travels the world in search of a friend. By the end of the song, it's said that Amumu's fragile soul couldn't bear the curse anymore as he unleashed a destructive tantrum, destroying the town as he was tragically left alone once again.

Though its unclear what Amumu is looking for, whether it's redemption, companionship or just a simple act of kindness towards him, his quest remains unfulfilled as he continues to shamble around the sands aimlessly.

Recent Events

Though many still claim to encounter Amumu to this day, one storyteller named Khaldun stated that he stumbled upon Amumu's tomb after it cracked open during an earthquake. Traversing the tomb, he saw wall carvings that detailed Amumu's life with images depicting a young boy sitting atop the Shuriman Sun Disc and another carving depicting his deathbed being surrounded by people either mourning or celebrating.
After hearing the wails of what he thought was a lost child, he stumbled upon puddles of
salt water
, which he thought was impossible to find so deep underneath the deserts, and eventually Amumu, who hid himself in the shadows and refused to come out. Khaldun felt pity for him and asked if he was lost while Amumu simply replied that he was unsure of where he was or how he got there, having lost his memory over the thousands of years. Khaldun approached closer to comfort him until he realized that the young boy was in fact a mummy. As Amumu's bandaged hand grasped onto Khaldun's arm, he asked if he could be his friend while Khaldun looked at his arm in horror, watching it rapidly decompose to the point of completely falling off.
Khaldun quickly fled the tomb out of fear, leaving it open and supposedly releasing Amumu to wander the desert. Though the validity of this story is in question, Khaldun lived to tell this story to his grandchildren as an explanation to why he is missing an arm.

Though the validity of his tale is unclear, an old storyteller named Khaldun claims to his grandchildren that he survived an encounter with Amumu, having delved into his tomb and accidentally left it open once he escaped. According to Khaldun, Amumu's cursed touch withered away his arm with decay, being the reason behind his missing arm to this day.
