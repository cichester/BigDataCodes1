Early Life
[

edit source
]

Sylas of Dregbourne was born in
Demacia
, where he developed magical abilities at a young age. As per the typical Demacian belief that magic was an affliction, Sylas' parents convinced him to turn himself in to the
Mageseekers
. The Mageseekers took notice of Sylas' ability to sense the magic within people, so they used his power to identify the mages within the city. But Sylas began to notice the prominence of mages living their lives as civilians, having to live with being labeled as criminals by Demacian society, which caused him to doubt his standing within Demacia.
One day, Sylas and his Mageseeker handlers found a young mage girl in the countryside, forced to live in hiding to avoid persecution. Sylas took pity on her due to being so young so he tried to protect her from his handlers, but he accidentally brushed against her skin, causing Sylas to fire her lightning magic uncontrollably, resulting in the deaths of the girl as well as two Mageseekers. Sylas tried to evade the law, but he was labelled as the most dangerous mage alive and when he was caught, he was sentenced to imprisonment for life.

Imprisonment
[

With his hands chained by petricite shackles, Sylas was imprisoned in a Mageseeker compound for fifteen years, growing disillusioned and vengeful towards the kingdom and seeking its downfall. One day,
Luxanna Crownguard
of the
Crownguard House
found him in the compound and sympathized with him for his plight, with both soon forming a steady bond. While Lux visited Sylas to teach him about the world outside his cell and gave him books to read, and in exchange he taught her how to control her magic. One of the books Sylas recieved was
Galio
's blueprint by Durand, where he learned about the true properties of petricite and how it did not nullify magic, but accumulate it until it reached its breaking point. All he needed to do now was touch Lux to absorb her magic into his shackles and break free.
Eventually, the Crownguards found out about Lux's meetings with Sylas, so he was sentenced to public execution by sword. Lux intervened by telling the crowd by advocating for Sylas' rights, but he touched her and unleashed a powerful blast of Lux's magic, killing everyone on scene except Lux.

The Birth of the Revolution
[

Freed from the authorities, Sylas used his powers to destroy the Mageseeker compound and free the imprisoned mages to start a revolution against Demacia for their persecution of mages. He led them to the royal castle to capture
7
King Jarvan III
and publicly humiliate him, but to his surprise the king had already been killed before he arrived. His son, Prince
Jarvan IV
, blamed Sylas and the mages for causing the death of his father, while Sylas decided to humiliate him instead. Sylas tied Jarvan IV to a chair and forced him to eat a rat to reflect the terrible conditions experienced by the prisoners of the compound, but Lux came to stop him, with her magic suppressed after drinking a petricite mixture. She shot a crossbow at Sylas and stabbed him in the foot before releasing Jarvan IV.
The
Dauntless Vanguard
arrived in time, led by Lux's brother
Garen Crownguard
. Lux warned Garen to avoid letting Sylas touch his petricite armaments, so Garen grabbed an axe to strike him. Sylas counterattacked Garen by absorbing the magic of one of his downed allies, but Jarvan IV put him at a chokehold to avenge his father. Sylas was outnumbered by the Demacian army, so he told his allies to retreat into the sewers to escape Demacia. As he began to leave, Lux tried to warn the mages not to follow him, but he told them that there was no need to worry about her because she wouldn't hurt an innocent.
Due to Jarvan IV blaming Sylas' revolution for the death of King Jarvan III, he enforced a zero-tolerance policy towards magic in Demacia, causing innocent mages in Demacia to be sentenced to merciless treatment by the Mageseekers. Out of desperation, some mages planned to flee Demacia to migrate to Sylas' camp so they would be safe.

Appearance
[

edit source
]

Sylas is an adult man with fair skin, a slim, athletic yet muscular build, he has shoulder-length black hair, thick eyebrows, blue eyes, and a short beard.
He doesn't wear a shirt and leaves his chest exposed, he has broken manacles around his neck and forearms with broken yellow petricite chains, likewise he also wears gray pants and goes barefoot using bandages on his feet.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Sylas is a ruthless, determined rebel who opposes Demacia's unfair persecution of mages regardless of their intentions. When he was younger, he initially wanted to protect his fellow mages from being harmed by his Mageseeker associates, but after the incident which got him imprisoned, Sylas grew to resent the kingdom after fifteen years of imprisonment. After being freed, he took on the role of a martyr for his fellow mages, inspiring them to join his rebellion. His initial goal was to raze Demacia to the ground, with no prospect of the aftermath. Despite his devotion to his cause, he harboured deep remorse towards his betrayal of Lux.
During his revolution against the Mageseekers, Sylas gradually developed a change of heart thanks to Leilani's influence, letting go of his desire for vengeance and learning to value his fellow rebels, even being more merciful towards his enemies. He was heavily affected by the deaths of the allies that he had lost on the way, striving to become a better leader for their sake. After achieving victory, Sylas split his alliance with the Demacians and started fighting against them again, believing that because the Demacian government would enable an ideology like the Mageseekers to happen, mages would never be truly free until the monarchy is abolished.

Mage
:
Sylas was born with natural magic abilities that can improve as he trains. Though he initially trained under the
Mageseekers
, who weaponized his abilities for their own agendas, he trained and honed his abilities further while in prison.
Magic Sight:
Sylas was born with the ability to see magic in the form of visual colors, particularly when it emanates off of other mages. Because of this special skill, Sylas was inducted into the Mageseekers at a young age, who weaponized his ability to hunt down mages hiding in
Demacia
.
Magic Absorption & Replication:
Sylas has the innate ability to absorb magical energy into himself, allowing him to almost perfectly replicate other magical abilities.
[

]
Sylas can absorb magic by simply touching another mage, but he can also absorb energy from inherently magical materials, notably
petricite
that has already absorbed residual magic. Sylas's absorption isn't exclusive to mages and he has shown that he's capable of absorbing and mimicking the magical abilities of magical fauna. Though the extent of this ability isn't fully known, it may improve as Sylas learns to absorb other forms of magical energy.
Elemental Magic Absorption:
Sylas can absorb and replicate almost every form of Elemental magic, such as how he replicated
Lux's
light magic
.
Iceborn Frost Resistance:
Sylas is capable of absorbing the innate abilities of the
Iceborn
, perfectly mimicking their resistance to cold temperatures and possibly granting him the ability to wield
True Ice
.
Celestial Magic Absorption:
By tapping into the residual magic energies left within ancient petricite structures, Sylas can absorb the Celestial magics of
Kayle
and
Morgana
, who have inherent abilities tied to the
Aspects
.
Blessing of The Veiled Lady:
During the
Great Mage Rebellion
, Sylas was granted a magical blessing by
Morgana
herself, granting him some of her abilities and empowering his innate talent to harness other magics.
Petricite Shackles:
In combat, Sylas uses the same petricite shackles that bound him in prison. Using these chains, Sylas can expel magical energies absorbed through the petricite,
absorb
magic that touches his chains and strike enemies with intense physical force.

Sylas was abducted by the Mageseekers at a very young age and had his magic detection abilities used to find and capture other mages. After an incident where Sylas ended up killing two mageseekers by accident to protect a little girl, he fled to the wilderness. Eventually he would be caught by the mageseekers and imprisoned for 15 years. He would harbor great resentment of his captors as they would treat him like an animal and barely give him any food.

Luxanna Crownguard
[

edit source
]

Sylas formed a bond with
Lux
while he was imprisoned. In exchange for information of the outside world, he would teach her to control her magic due to magic being outlawed in Demacia. He later manipulated her and used her power to escape. He would eventually make amends with her and come to her aid when the mageseekers attacked her mages settlement. While Lux has not forgotten Sylas' betrayal, she undestands he is more than just a murderer.

Garen Crownguard
[

Garen
. He would best him in every fight they had, only retreating when Garen's reinforcements arrived.

After escaping his execution, Sylas and his followers almost executed
Jarvan IV
before fleeing. He had intended to execute Jarvan III, but then found out that the king was already mysteriously dead in the chamber he and his guard retinue had retreated to.

Winter's Claw
[

Sylas would form an alliance with the
Winter's Claw
, who later helps him attack
Demacia
.

Galio
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Sylas encountered
Galio
who came to aid Lux, Garen, and other Demacian soldiers during this attack on Demacia from the north.
Lux got Durand's original texts, which include Galio's design specs, for Sylas to read. On the mention of the colossus, she states that she "knows" him as if speaking of a person and not as a statue. (She had befriended him when she was 13.)
[

]
Sylas clearly found her wording odd but occupied with the texts, did not question her about it, apparently not realizing that Durand's wording on Galio meant that absorbing magic allows him to move on his own.
Sylas's own shackles were originally built by Durand, who also designed
Galio
, to restrain powerful demons like
Tahm Kench
and
Evelynn
.

Kayle
and
Morgana
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Sylas
knows certain truths about the
winged
sisters
and calls out their power during the events of
Lux comics
. He also believed the Veiled Lady is an absent deity, not coming to aid to those who pray to her every night. Sylas would eventually meet Morgana and learn that she was one of the Winged Protectors as well as the Veiled Lady. He sought her aid in his war against the mageseekers, but she refused to grant him, seeing consumed by vengeance. After being humbled by Leilani's death, Sylas was willing to give up his revenge and received Morgana's blessing.
