Background

Nocturne was inadvertently created during the tail end of the
Rune Wars
. Escalating tensions led desperate mages to resort to shadow magic, casting off their flesh and stepping into the
spirit realm
. Shadow mages became so powerful and pervasive that Nocturne was brought to life within the spirit realm, though the exact details of its manifestation remain a mystery. Nocturne preyed on the mages who entered its domain so thoroughly and brutally that shadow magic become known as a dangerous and forbidden art. As the number of shadow mages dwindled, Nocturne languished in the spirit realm, starving for centuries.
In recent years, however, Nocturne has found the means to materialize in the physical world, and now preys on mortal fear wherever it can.

Nocturne is made of pure, inky-black darkness, only vaguely humanoid with a head and two arms. Its fingers appear clawed and its head is featureless save for two solid white eyes. From the waist down, its body seems to dissolve into a plume of black smoke.
It is usually seen wearing armor, either purple or red with a gray trim. It wears a breastplate and two large, spiked pauldrons. Its signature weapons are a pair of massive blades attached to either forearm, both viciously curved with numerous points.

Personality

Nocturne is a
demonic
entity that thrives on the nourishment derived from fear induced by nightmares. This malevolent being possesses an intimate understanding of individuals' deepest fears, allowing it to expertly exploit and manipulate their vulnerabilities. In its pursuit of sustenance, Nocturne revels in the psychological torment it inflicts upon its victims, creating an atmosphere of profound dread and isolation.
In its insatiable quest for mortal fear, Nocturne revels in the perverse satisfaction derived from plunging the world into shadows. This malefic entity holds an innate disdain for the brilliance of light and seeks to envelop every soul it encounters in an eternal abyss of darkness. In this relentless pursuit, Nocturne spares no mercy for the innocent and remorselessly extinguishes life, all while feeding voraciously on the exquisite banquet of nightmares and the paralyzing grip of terror.
