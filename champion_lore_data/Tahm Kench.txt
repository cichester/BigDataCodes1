Tahm Kench is a catfish-like humanoid with a large, rotund body, short, stubby limbs, and a tail. His most noticeable feature is his enormous mouth, lined with rows of countless uneven fangs and containing a long, prehensile tongue. He has a thick, mustache-like pair of catfish
barbels
on his upper lip. He has shiny green skin, pale in the front with darker green markings across his back. His wide-set eyes are a sinister, solid yellow. He has three clawed fingers on each hand and four clawed toes on each foot. He also has dark red fins on his tail and elbows.
Tahm attempts to dress as a gentleman, though his clothes appear too small for his massive form, particularly the black human-sized top hat which is dwarfed by his oversized head. The hat features a dark red ribbon edge trim and a golden accessory on the side. He also wears a dark maroon dress shirt and what appears to be two overcoats (one brown and the other dark blue) stitched together into one. The sleeves are missing, seemingly unable to fit his bulky arms, but he still wears the detached cuffs on his wrists with additional wrappings on his hands. The clothes are worn and ragged with faded golden buttons. He also wears a gold ring with a green gem on his left index finger and another gold ring on his left barbel.

Personality

Tahm Kench is a voracious being that is constantly hungry and craves nothing more than to indulge himself with as much as he can consume. He is cruel and manipulative, taking advantage of those that are vulnerable to make them make deals with him, using an affable fa√ßade to trick others into trusting him, using their desires to lure them to their doom.
