Early Life
[

edit source
]

Samira was born in the city of
Amakra
in Shurima, located at the edge of the
the Great Sai
. She and her parents made a living as street performers, dazzling and beguiling onlookers, which thrilled her but worried her parents who wished for their daughter to have a more stable life.
At the eve of her fourteenth birthday, Amakra was attacked by a massive army of strange cultists that swarmed the city, invoking the name of an
ancient magus
and killing innocent villagers before her very eyes. Instead of crying or screaming however, Samira seethed in anger, both at the invaders as well as herself for hiding, as it was the first time she's ever felt crippled by fear despite all the daring stunts she performed as an acrobat. With that, she vowed never to feel scared and helpless again in the face of danger.

Taking Refuge in Bel'zhun
[

Though they were wounded, Samira and her parents escaped to the port city of
Bel'zhun
, which was currently under
Noxian
occupation. Many Amakrans fled to the city as refugees, seeing it as safe haven provided by the Noxian empire. Samira's parents were too weary and injured to continue performing on the streets, so she decided to perform as a lone acrobat in order to support her family, using it as an opportunity to be fearless and outdoing herself with every stunt. Unfortunately, street performing simply wouldn't be enough to support her parents, so Samira set off to find other opportunities. Samira enlisted to join a Noxian warband, drawn to both the excitement as well as the financial resources it would provide.
As a member of the warband, Samira trained for two years, impressing her peers with her excellence in combat combined with her acrobatic athleticism. However, she faltered in discipline, frusturating her commanding officers due to her reckless attitude. The only officer that saw past her reckless attitude was a former saboteur named
Indari
, who valued her fearlessness and offered her a position in her private warband instead; a specialized unit charged with missions too perilous for standard military personnel, to which Samira agreed without hesitation.
Overtime, Samira began to fully embrace Noxian culture, finding her own strength in her dazzling flair and sense of style in battle. Through life-and-death shootouts and breathtaking swordfights, Samira would get tattoos representing her most dangerous feats, showing them off to her family every chance she got.

Attack at Rokrund
[

]

Under direct orders from the capital, Indari's unit was sent to crush a secessionist uprising at the
Rokrund Plains
. When the warband located the enemy stronghold and found the rebel leader, the fortress exploded with Indari inside. Samira, in an attempt to save her captain, dove headfirst into the stronghold as it collapsed, feeling no sense of fear and wasting no time in recovering her captain. Miraculously, the two of them actually survived the explosion, though Samira suffered a permanent injury to her right eye while Indari lost the ability to use her legs. Frustrated with their failure, Indari gathered as many survivors as she could but officially disbanded the unit.

Becoming a Mercenary
[

Samira, now discharged and sent back to Bel'zhun, continued to desire the life of action she once had while in Indari's warband, no longer pleased with a quiet stable life within the port city. Seeking her former captain out, Samira returned to the Noxian capital and met up with Indari, proposing that they form a new partnership. With Indari's connections to the military and the Noxian noble houses, she could operate behind the scenes while Samira acts as a high-stakes mercenary under Indari's command. Reluctantly, she agreed, but refused to grant Samira any field support in fear of making the same mistakes as she did in Rokrund.

Modern History
[

edit source
]

Samira thrived as a mercenary, taking the most daring missions handed to her by Indari, which were originally meant for entire warbands. She happily undertook these missions, gaining a reputation as a daredevil that completed every perilous job no matter the odds against her, even gaining recognition by the Noxian high command.
Some of Samira's most famous feats while taking on these missions included beating a
Chem-Baron
in hand-to-hand combat, being the lone survivor of a massive
Bilgewater
raid, scaling mountains and arm-wrestling outlaws in crowded taverns. With no sense of slowing down, Samira continued her life on the edge, constantly seeking the next thrill.

The Hunt for Rell
[

Samira fighting off one of the guards at the compound while riding atop a
basilisk
.
Samira was eventually assigned a mission to locate a dangerous
weapon
that threatened the Noxian empire, which was located within a compound deep in the southern jungles of
Qualthala
, and leave no survivors. Before her mission, Samira visited a weapons shop called
Lani
and
Miel
Munitions
, accompanied by Indari. There, she met two
Zaunite
weaponsmiths named Lani and Miel, who also had apprentices that moonlit as tattoo artists. In the shop, Samira saw a pair of
notably flashy pistols
displayed in a glass case and instantly decided to buy them without much thought, which annoyed Indari.
After buying a new set of equipment for the job, Samira set off to the compound in Qualthala, finding a building devoid of markings with wooden doors that were already smashed to pieces as well as strangely warped pieces of metal scattered around. She encountered and killed two guards in the compound before alerting some warmasons and executing them in a
flurry of gunfire
. After hopping over a crushed balcony and landing in an open courtyard, Samira noticed another building in the distance that also had its doors smashed apart, noting that someone else must've beat her to the weapon she was assigned to locate.
Two soldiers wielding axes and riding massive
basilisks
charged towards Samira in the courtyard, making note of a
null kid
and questioning if Rell sent Samira to the compound to 'clean up the mess,' a name that Samira had never heard of but also didn't care much for as she managed to kill one of the riders and mount his basilisk, jousting with the second rider before using her
specialized blade
to pierce through his armor by empowering it with black powder.
Finally entering the building, Samira found a crumbling stairway and followed it into a stone prison cell full of even more warped pieces of metal, with the door completely obliterated while the back wall had a massive hole opened into the jungle. Examining the room more, she noticed a small cot seemingly fit for a child, which was split by jagged shards of metal. Here, she took a seat and drank from her flask, realizing the weapon had gotten away but congratulating it for 'getting her attention,' seemingly vowing to continue her search.
Weeks later, Samira returned to the weapons shop with Indari to get a new tattoo drawn by one of the apprentices in the store. Indari questioned Samira on how her new equipment performed on the mission, to which Samira answered that her new guns were exquisite and revealed she intended to be using them for a long time. After paying for the tattoo and leaving, the tattoo artist revealed himself to actually be
LeBlanc
in disguise, who had been working with Captain Indari and commanded her to give Samira whatever resources she needs, noting her importance to the empire and the missions she would be sent off on.

managed to get a hold of

Darius

Trifarian Legion
. When the Black Mist manifested in Noxus, it appeared atop the
Immortal Bastion
and nearly got a a hold of her before Darius pushed her out of the way. As the Black Mist quickly spread across the city, hoards of
Wraiths
appeared and attacked the Trifarian Legion, causing Samira to join in the fight to assist her fellow Noxians. During this however, the Black Mist took a hold of Darius's mind, controlling him under Viego's will and forcing him to attack Samira, which she narrowly evaded. During the fight, the Black Mist suddenly ceased, allowing Samira and a weakened Darius to recover while looking cautiously at the Immortal Bastion, where the Black Mist poured into Noxus from.
