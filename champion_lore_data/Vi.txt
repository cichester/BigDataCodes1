Childhood
[

edit source
]

Violet
was born in
Zaun
, where she was raised by her parents
Felicia
and
Connol
with her younger sister
Powder
. Their parents were miners
[
3
]
and they grew up poor, with Vi and Powder having to share a bed in their tiny house located deep in the trenches. As children, Vi and her sister played a game where they pretended to be scary monsters. Vi often got carried away causing Powder to get scared, but would then comfort her little sister by saying that no monster would ever take her as long as she was around.
[
4
]
Even from a young age, Vi could never shake the feeling that she was less than the people of
Piltover
, who both prospered and ruled over them from across the river.
[
5
]
This feeling was common across the undercity, and on one fateful day their people would clash at the Bridge of Progress, where Vi's parents would be killed during an uprising against the
Piltover Enforcers
. When the conflict was over, Vi tried to protect her sister from seeing the bloodshed around them, but broke down in tears as she saw her parents' bodies dead on the bridge. Shortly after, Vi and her sister were adopted by
Vander
, who was an old friend of their mother's and one of the leaders of the uprising. As Vander carried them away from the violence, Vi glared hatefully at the golden towers of Piltover, vowing to do whatever it took to one day make topside respect them.
[
6
]
As she grew older, Vi watched as Vander hung up his
gauntlets
and became a barkeeper at the Last Drop, giving up his fight against topside. Vi struggled to understand Vander's actions, but eager to prove herself to him, would often engage in illegal activities, such as heists, robberies, and brawls with the other kids. At some point, Vander adopted two boys named
Mylo
and
Claggor
, who would become Vi's sidekicks during her adventures. Vi's sister Powder would sometimes tag along, even though she was the youngest and would often fall behind. Mylo would often complain about Powder's incompetence, calling her a "jinx," but Vi was always there to support her, taking interest in the gadgets and toys Powder would build in her spare time. Powder's best friend
Ekko
, who they called "Little Man", would often act as their informant for their jobs, giving tips about interesting locations for them to rob. Vander would allow Vi's heists as a source of income, with his one rule being that she never mess with topside, and that the other side of the river was off-limits to them.
[

The Robbery
[
edit

edit source
]


One day, Vi received a tip from Ekko about a wealthy
topsider
, and Vi, believing she was now old enough to handle a job in Piltover, took her gang there without Vander's permission. With Mylo, Claggor, and Powder in tow, the four of them robbed the man's apartment, finding it full of expensive equipment, and they began collecting anything they could get their hands on. Unfortunately, the man returned before they could escape through the balcony, and a large explosion suddenly shook and destroyed the building, revealing their location to the Enforcers. Vi and her gang fled the scene of the crime, and as they returned with their bag of newly-acquired items, they encountered a group of thugs led by
Deckard
, who attempted to steal their loot. Powder, who had the bag at the time, was forced to toss the loot into the river to escape. Mylo blamed Powder for the loss, but Vi went easier on her, and the group returned to Vander's bar empty-handed.
[
6
]
Vander, who had heard about the explosion on topside, was livid with Vi and scolded her for disobeying his orders, impressing upon her that as the leader of her group, she had a responsibility to the people she was supposed to protect. Vi, however, believed that Vander's reluctance to fight back against Piltover was allowing Enforcers to run rampant through their streets, and this would only worsen in the following days as the authorities began to hunt down the culprits of the robbery. Despite losing the rest of the loot, Powder had managed to stow a handful of small blue crystals in her pocket, which nearly got Vi and her crew caught twice. As she worried about her family, Vi learned that Vander had a secret deal with the Piltover Sheriff,
Grayson
, and confronted him about it, after which Vander took Vi to the Bridge of Progress and explained that nothing good had come of his failed rebellion, and that it was his own fault Vi's parents were dead. Taking Vander's words to heart, Vi came to the conclusion that she should take full responsibility for the robbery to protect her siblings and decided to turn herself in.
[

The Fatal Rescue
[
edit
|
edit source
]

As Grayson and her deputy
Marcus
came to arrest Vi, Vander stepped in and offered himself in her place, locking her in the basement to prevent her from interfering. From the window, Vi watched in horror from the window as a local gangster named
Silco
arrived with a hulking, mutated Deckard, who murdered Grayson and kidnapped Vander, dragging him to Silco's criminal headquarters. To rescue their father, Vi brought Mylo and Claggor along to Silco's hideout, leaving Powder behind, as Vi was concerned for her safety. Vi gave Powder a blue flare to light up in case she found herself in trouble before leaving to find her father.
[
7
]
However, upon reuniting with Vander, Vi and her crew soon discovered they had been led into a trap, as Silco was now seeking to get rid of Vander and all his kids as a way of seizing control of the undercity. In the resulting battle, Vi donned Vander's
gauntlets
and bested several of Silco's henchmen, until she was forced to flee from the mutated Deckard. Just as Mylo and Claggor had secured their escape route, another explosion shook the building, just like the one that busted their robbery at topside. Mylo and Claggor were both killed by the debris, and in his efforts to save Vi, Vander took up arms against Silco's goons and even took
shimmer
, which transformed him into a hulking mutant. While rescuing Vi from the collapsing building, Vander would fall and seemingly perish, with his final words being to "Take care of Powder."
[
7
]
When Powder arrived shortly after, she revealed that the explosion had been caused by one of her bombs, and to Vi's horror, she realized that her sister had been responsible for the deaths of their entire family. In a moment of rage and anguish, Vi struck Powder in the face and angrily yelled that Mylo was right about her being a jinx. However, as Vi watched her sister cry and plead with her on the ground, Vi realized she had gone too far and walked away, crying against the wall. Silco would eventually find Powder, and seeing he had a knife, Vi rushed to go save her sister. Unfortunately, she was prevented from doing so by Marcus, who drugged her unconscious and dragged her to Stillwater Hold.

Life in Prison

Main article:
The Warden's Write-Ups

Vi spent the next few years imprisoned in Stillwater, where she was held without a trial or any details of her crimes. Vi spent her days attempting escapes and defending against assassination attempts from murderous prisoners. Prison guards viewed Vi as a troublemaker as she was unruly and was violent against others, who that were presumably dangerous undercity criminals,
[
8
]
and the
Warden
would have frequent "chats" with her whenever she was uncooperative with the Enforcers.
[

]
Nevertheless, the thought of reuniting with her sister gave Vi the determination to persevere in the face of harsh prison life.

Piltovan Bicentennial
[

Return to Zaun
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Following the celebration of
Piltover's
bicentennial Progress Day, Vi encountered one of
Silco's
henchmen
and assaulted him in the cafeteria.
[
11
]
As a result of the fight, Vi was visited by
Caitlyn Kiramman
, who was investigating Silco and showed Vi photographs of a crime scene. Vi quickly recognized the graffiti as one of
Powder's
drawings and became interested in Caitlyn's investigation, offering to act as her guide through
Zaun
. Caitlyn released Vi from Stillwater by forging an official order from Councilor
Jayce Talis
, and the two of them began to hunt for clues regarding Silco's activities. To blend in, Vi stole clothes from some thugs so that she and Caitlyn could disguise themselves as locals, all while trying to adjust to how much the undercity had changed under Silco's rule.
[
9
]
After following the trail for some time, Vi attacked Silco's top henchwoman
Sevika
for information, and she learned to her horror that Powder had been adopted by Silco and was now going by the name
Jinx
. Vi was stabbed in the brawl and was rescued by Caitlyn,
[
9
]
who managed to get her shelter and medical treatment the remains of Vi's childhood home. After a tense confrontation with Silco and his other henchmen, Vi finally located Jinx after she ignited the blue flare she'd give her all those years ago, and Vi rushed to the tower to meet her. The sisters experienced a tearful reunion at the top and were overjoyed to learn the other was still alive. However, Jinx had changed in the time they had been apart, becoming more violent and paranoid as a result of her trauma. When she saw Caitlyn, Jinx reacted violently, accusing Vi of trying to trick her so she could take a small
blue gemstone
; which confused Vi, as she did not know what the gemstone was. Before Vi could properly reassure Jinx that she wouldn't leave her again, they were attacked by the
Firelights
, who swept in and kidnapped Vi and Caitlyn before making off with the gemstone.
[
12
]
At the Firelight hideout, Vi was angry with Caitlyn for using her to get to the gemstone, and at her captors for taking her away just as she was getting through to Jinx. However, Vi soon learned the Firelight leader was
Ekko
, who had grown up during Vi's absence into a resistance leader against Silco's empire. Though Ekko was initially hesitant to trust Vi, as she was now working with an Enforcer, Vi managed to reconnect with Ekko and convinced him to help Caitlyn bring the gemstone back to Piltover, where they could inform the Council about Silco's activities. Before setting out, Vi also informed Ekko that she would stay behind in Zaun, as she still intended to reunite with Powder and pull her away from Silco's influence. Ekko argued that Jinx was a lost cause, but Vi decided she would not give up on her sister no matter what.
[
13
]
At the Bridge of Progress, Vi said goodbye to Caitlyn and Ekko as she started her way back to the undercity. However, upon hearing gunfire on the bridge, Vi rushed back to rescue Caitlyn, and shortly after the area was suddenly filled with explosions that killed all the Enforcers in the area. As the smoke cleared, Vi saw Jinx, who took the canister with the gemstone and suddenly attacked them with her minigun. The two of them were saved by Ekko, who handed them the canister and told Vi to get to Piltover as he held Jinx off. As Vi left the bridge, she heard an explosion,
[
13
]
and after getting Caitlyn to safety she tried to go back to check on Ekko and Jinx. She was unable to, as the area had been swarmed by Enforcers. Vi and Caitlyn quickly discovered the gemstone was also gone from the canister, meaning the crisis was likely to continue.

Taking Down Silco
[
edit
|
edit source
]

With no way back to her sister, Vi decided the only way left to save her was to destroy the source of the problem, which she deemed to be Silco himself. Vi accompanied Caitlyn to the
Kiramman
home in Piltover, where they asked Caitlyn's mother, Councilor
Cassandra Kiramman
, for an audience with the Council. Later in Caitlyn's room, Vi was impressed with the detective bulletin she had mapped out before her investigation, and the two of them shared a sad moment together as Vi explained that she never forgave herself for "running away" from Powder all those years ago. Later that evening, Vi and Caitlyn went to deliver their speech to the Council room.
Though they managed to inform the Council that Silco was the true mastermind of the recent crisis, the Council itself remained at an impasse, as they were unable to agree on the proper steps to defuse the situation. Vi had been hoping to enlist the Council's help in dismantling Silco's empire, and when they refused to take drastic measures she became angry, accusing them of being naive in thinking Silco would ever want to negotiate with them. The Councilors reacted coldly to Vi's outburst, and believing the topsiders didn't respect her, she left both them and Caitlyn to go handle things on her own, claiming that topside and bottom were like "oil and water".
[
4
]
Since Jayce had been the only Councilor willing to support taking on Silco head-on, Vi snuck into his workshop and asked him to join her on an unsanctioned raid on one of his underground shimmer factories, hoping to cripple the
chembarons
' enterprises. When Jayce agreed to the raid, Vi armed herself with his hextech
Atlas gauntlets
, which she used as giant boxing gloves, and Jayce completed a hextech weapon of his own, the
Mercury Hammer
.
[
4
]
Although their raid on Silco's factory was successful, Jayce withdrew his support for Vi after his actions caught a Zaunite child in the crossfire, and he decided it would be better to seek peace with Silco than to start an all-out war. Vi, still determined to save her sister, refused to relinquish the gauntlets and continued without him, engaging Silco's goons in the Last Drop and defeating Sevika all on her own. However, when the battle was over, Vi was suddenly ambushed by Jinx, who knocked her out with the bottom of her pistol.
[

The Tea Party
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Vi woke up tied to a chair in the ruins of Silco's original hideout, which Jinx had destroyed in the explosion all those years ago. Jinx had redecorated the wreckage into a colorful, poorly-lit tea room with chairs set up for all the friends and family they had lost in the disaster, including Mylo, Claggor, and Vander. There were also two chairs marked for
Powder
and
Jinx
, and Jinx asked Vi where she should sit. Silco and Caitlyn were both present at the tea party, similarly tied to their chairs and gagged.
[
10
]
With everyone in place, Jinx handed her pistol to Vi, stating that if she shot Caitlyn right then and there, she could "have Powder back." Vi refused, horrified by her sister's suggestion, and Jinx then moved to kill Caitlyn herself. As Vi begged for Caitlyn's life, they were interrupted by Silco, who declared that Vi had forsaken her sister long ago and therefore could not be trusted, and that he was the only one who truly cared for her. As Vi feared she was once again losing her sister to Silco, Caitlyn broke free from her restraints and threatened Jinx with her
minigun
. Vi begged Caitlyn not to hurt her, and as Caitlyn hesitated, Jinx attacked and knocked the Enforcer unconscious, taking back her weapon. Silco then ordered Jinx to finish her, and Vi desperately tried to remind Jinx of their loved ones, hoping it would bring Powder back. Her pleas only seemed to worsen Jinx's mental state, and in a frenzy, Jinx whirled around firing her minigun, narrowly missing Vi and mortally wounding Silco in the process. Vi watched as the Eye of Zaun died in his daughter's arms, ending his reign of terror once and for all.
[
10
]
Seeing Jinx was distraught over Silco's death, Vi tried to comfort her, claiming that now things could go back to the way they used to be. Jinx simply responded by walking towards the chair labeled "Jinx" and sitting down in it, casting off her old identity as Powder before claiming things would never be the same between them. With that, Jinx used the gemstone to complete her newest
weapon
before firing a
rocket
towards Piltover. Vi and Caitlyn watched in horror as it destroyed the Piltovan Council chambers, and Jinx disappeared into Zaun.
[

Becoming an Enforcer
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Caitlyn's mother had been killed by Jinx's attack, and after being present for the funeral, Vi remained in Caitlyn's home to the annoyance of her father,
Tobias
. Vi was later surprised and insulted when Caitlyn offered Vi a place among the Enforcers, as she still blamed them for the death of her parents. However, a second terrorist attack led by one of Silco's chembaron lieutenants,
Renni
, would change Vi's mind, and after helping to fend off the attack, Vi decided to join Caitlyn's new strike team, which consisted of
Loris
,
Maddie
, and
Steb
. The objectives of their mission were to completely wipe clean the remnants of Silco's collapsing criminal empire, which included the elimination of shimmer, the remaining chembarons, and Jinx herself.
[
14
]
Caitlyn and Vi employed brutal tactics against Silco's forces, including the weaponization of the Gray — a toxic industrial smog that the Kirammans had stored in a series of vents — as a means to clear the streets of civilians and flush out gangsters. The strike team's efforts allowed them to convince
Smeech
to capture and hand over Jinx in exchange for her bounty, and to dismantle the operations of
Margot
and
Chross
, who were either killed or apprehended as a result of their efforts.
[
15
]
[
16
]
Once the chembarons were all dealt with, Vi and Caitlyn made their through the undercity levels to defeat Jinx, who strung them along with a series of traps, tricks, and surprises. Worried for the safety of the others, the two of them decided it would be better to send the others home for their own safety, as Vi deemed Jinx her own responsibility. When Caitlyn asked if Vi was truly willing to kill her own sister, Vi said her sister was "gone" and changed beyond recognition. Vi then pleaded with Caitlyn to never change on her, and the two of them shared a kiss as they readied themselves for the battle ahead of them.
[

Confronting Jinx
[
edit
|
edit source
]


Vi and Caitlyn tracked Jinx to
Janna's
temple, which she had decorated with a series of colorful drawings depicting her life with Vi. Vi planned to lure Jinx out so that Caitlyn could
snipe
and kill her from a distance, and when Vi stepped out, she was greeted by Jinx's voice. After an exchange of many angry, bitter words, Jinx tricked Caitlyn into revealing her position using a mirror and sent Sevika to fight her. Jinx then stepped out with her arsenal of weapons and attacked Vi, resulting in a brutal and chaotic battle between the two of them. Eventually, Jinx lost the fight and seemingly accepted her fate, causing Vi to hesitate long enough for a
Zaunite child
to rush over and place herself between the Enforcers and Jinx. With this new development, Vi went to stop Caitlyn from shooting, as it would catch the girl in the crossfire. Caitlyn missed her chance to kill Jinx as a result, and Sevika activated a bomb that sent the Gray back toward Vi and Caitlyn, trapping them outside the temple. When the dust settled, Caitlyn blamed Vi for their mission's failure and abandoned her in the undercity, leaving Vi heartbroken.

Martial Law Period
[

Cage Fighter
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Now all alone in
Zaun
, Vi left the
Piltover Enforcers
to become a pit fighter in
Tommy's
arena, where she beat the butterflyweight champion of the
Piltover
Boxing League,
Gustove "the Scowler" Jowler
, with just one punch. This began a destructive cycle over the next few months where Vi would fight for money, spend the money on drinks, black out, then start the whole process over again. She was frequently helped back to her apartment by
Loris
, her old squadmate who and only friend during this time, and they would share drinks together to celebrate her numerous victories. Even so, the fights weren't enough to help her forget about Caitlyn, and when Vi's frustrations finally grew to a breaking point, she ended up pushing him away as well.
[

Saving Vander
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Eventually, Vi received a visit from
Jinx
, who attempted to reconcile with her by breaking into her apartment. Vi was initially hostile to Jinx, who explained that
Vander
was still alive. Vi believed Jinx was either lying or hallucinating as usual and tried to kill her, but was again unable to bring herself to, and she reluctantly decided to accompany Jinx and her companion
Isha
to the mines. As they searched for Vander, Jinx and Vi argued and fought the entire way, but when Vi's fists accidentally hurt Isha, she realized how much Jinx and the girl cared for each other. Eventually, they located Vander's old home, in which they found a letter from Vander to Silco apologizing for trying to drown him after their failed rebellion at the bridge. The letter resonated with Vi, and she seemed to wonder if she could forgive Jinx for all she had done. Outside, they were attacked by
Warwick
, a bloodthirsty chemtech beast who'd been set on their trail by Isha's nosebleed. Vi used her gauntlets to defend Jinx and Isha from the beast, but Jinx begged Vi not to hurt him, as the beast was actually Vander. While initially doubting Jinx, Vi decided to trust her and lowered her gauntlets, calling out for her father. Vander heard her voice, reawakening his old memories as the two embraced. Vi invited Jinx to join them, and their family had been reunited.
[
17
]
Hoping to bring Vander back fully, Vi and Jinx came upon the
commune
of
Viktor
, whom they heard was a magic healer who could perform miracles. Viktor offered to help recover Vander's mind for them, on the condition that he remain restrained at night. As they waited, Vi and Jinx visited the ruins of their old childhood home, which was located on the outskirts of Viktor's commune, and Vi wondered if they could stay there and live as a family again. However, the
Noxian
army of
Ambessa Medarda
soon marched on the sanctuary, and Vi watched as an old
doctor
entered the commune and later left the place where Viktor was treating Warwick. Realizing the army was here for her father, she began to follow the old man back to Ambessa's camp, and she was suddenly ambushed by Caitlyn, who had been working with Ambessa ever since they had broken up.
[
3
]
Though they argued briefly, the pair were happy to see one another, and after explaining her situation, she managed to enlist Caitlyn's help to save Vander, but also went behind Caitlyn's back to have Jinx retrieve her
Zapper
and keep watch.
[
18
]
To keep Ambessa occupied, Caitlyn pretended to capture Vi and brought her to Ambessa's tent, where she distracted and eventually subdued the warlord using a
net
from Caitlyn's rifle, as Caitlyn rescued Vander from Ambessa's alchemist. When Vi had made it back to the commune, Vander's mind had seemingly been restored. However, the cultists around Viktor's commune suddenly let out a bloodcurdling scream to the heavens, and Warwick too let out a
scream
before going berserk, killing Ambessa's second-in-command
Rictus
. In the ensuing battle, Ambessa's forces destroyed everything, leaving Vi injured and Jinx distraught as Isha destroyed herself in a massive explosion to end Warwick's rampage.
[

Battle at the Hexgate
[
edit
|
edit source
]

When Vi came to, she was greeted by Loris, and she learned that Ambessa was planning an invasion of the city, and that Jinx had handed herself in to the authorities after bringing Vi to safety. After failing to convince Caitlyn to let her go, Vi snuck into the prison and freed her sister, hoping she could use her inventions to defend Piltover so that she might be forgiven her past crimes. As she went to hug her, Jinx suddenly attacked Vi and locked her in the cell, claiming that no "good version" of her existed, and that Vi would be better off forgetting her and living a happy life with Caitlyn. When Vi asked Jinx what she was planning to do, Jinx replied that she would "break the cycle," before disappearing into the darkness.
[
18
]
Vi was eventually freed from the cell by Caitlyn. Vi was angry with herself for believing that Jinx would be willing to help, but Caitlyn told her not to worry about it, as she had intentionally reduced the number of guards earlier so they could have a moment alone together. As Caitlyn spoke to Vi, the two of them kissed again and had sex in the prison cell,
[
18
]
and after reaffirming their bond, the two of them joined
Jayce
and
Mel
to discuss strategy regarding Ambessa's incoming invasion.
[
19
]
The battle was fierce and brutal, as many of Ambessa's soldiers had been enhanced by shimmer and continuously tried to break past Piltovan defenses. Vi witnessed many of the casualties, including Loris, as Ambessa made steady progress. When all hope seemed lost, however, Vi was saved by Jinx, who returned on a mighty painted war balloon leading an army of Zaunites to support them. Vi was relieved to see her sister come back, and went to fight by her side when they were attacked by Warwick, who had been transformed into a mindless shell of his former self under Viktor's control. Vi and Jinx battled Warwick in the Hexgate near the crashed wreckage of her airship, but he got the upper hand on them as Viktor threatened to absorb all of Piltover with his
massive storm
. When Viktor was eventually defeated, Vi fell next to the now-lifeless body of her father, trapped near a precarious ledge. Though she heard Jinx calling to her, the sight of Vander's body brought her to tears again and she found herself too injured and distraught to move, and when Warwick awoke in his bestial, savage state, she lacked the strength and the will to properly defend herself. To save her sister, Jinx tossed herself and the beast into the tower below, activating a bomb that seemingly destroyed them in its blast. As she heard the explosion below her, Vi cried out in anguish, her voice echoing far outside the tower roof, unable to look below her as she lost them both for a second time.
[
19
]
Some time after the battle, Vi had seemingly recovered from Jinx's death and finally moved on, now living with in the
Kiramman
mansion and being willing to fight by her side whenever she asked.
[

Appearance
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Vi is fair skinned with an average height, muscular build, pale blue eyes and faint freckles. her hair is a reddish pink color, kept shaved on the left and falling over the right side of her face in pronounced spikes. her back and arms are extensively tattooed with what appears to be a gear powered exoskeleton emitting smoke that, in the middle, reaches from her neck down to the base of her back, and all the way down to her forearms, along with a tattoo of the roman numeral "VI" on her left cheek right under her eye, spelling her name. She has ring piercings on her left nostril and the helix of her left ear, and scars on her left eyebrow and the left side of her upper lip. Her attire consists of a white tank patterned top with a blue hood and matching blue sleeves that have been ripped off. Her top is tucked under a pair of baggy striped brown pants with a pocket on the left leg, and she wears two belts that hang down from her right hip over them, as well as hand wraps that cover her forearms and palms. She also wears a pair of worn and weathered knee-high boots, the left of which is missing laces and held together with bandages. While imprisoned at Stillwater, she wore the standard prisoner's uniform. After returning to the undercity, she beat up a man accosting her and stole his short red
leather jacket
with sleeves bunched up at the elbows and a belt hanging over the right shoulder, as well as blue accents that match her hood.
After joining the
Piltover Enforcers
, Vi would wear one of their blue uniforms, which included black and gold lining and armor pieces on the shoulders and knees, with bits of pink fabric sticking out of the side by the waist. On her hands she would wear her large metal
Atlas Gauntlets
, and on her head she would wear
Claggor's
goggles after recovering them from
Jinx
. During her time as a
cage fighter
, Vi would wear wrappings on her torso and a black and red leather jacket with a two-headed wolf on the back. She would also color her hair black and wearing dark makeup on her cheeks and eyes. While aiding in Piltover's defense, Vi wore metal battle armor with her Atlas Gauntlets.
As a child, her hair was a brighter pink and was kept swept back with two strands sticking to the side of her face in the shape of a V. She wore a cropped sleeveless brown jacket with a purple hood and a pauldron covering her right shoulder over a short sleeved white shirt and cropped pale yellow V-neck, along with mismatched baggy brown pants, and a brown leather glove on her left hand, with her right wrapped and bloodied at the knuckles.

Personality
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Vi is a tough, cocky, and hot-headed young woman with an impulsive streak and a very loose respect for authority figures. Growing up in
Zaun
, Vi was a tomboyish rebel and learned to be a fearsome and shrewd survivor to protect herself and the people she cared about. Vi was very protective of her little sister,
Powder
, and her fear of losing her loved ones led her to fight harder and sometimes recklessly seek out enemies with little thought to the danger she was putting herself in. After surviving many harsh years in Stillwater, Vi was toughened into a hardened rebel, and she was known to mock those who held her captive with her witty, abrasive sense of humor. Despite her tendency to fight first, and think later, she is very street smart, and her kind heart leads her to seek out and dish out justice, often violently and with no questions asked.
Vi has a fierce sense of responsibility and was haunted deep down by the guilt of leaving her sister behind, despite the fact that her disappearance was out of her control. The thought of getting back to
Jinx
motivated everything she did, and she was even willing to leave
Caitlyn
behind on several occasions to go after her alone. Her perception of topside led her to feel inferior for the vast majority of her life, but Caitlyn helped challenge this perspective by treating her with kindness and respect, and Vi ultimately worked to trust and find common ground with
Piltover
. Vi's street smarts make her an invaluable asset to Caitlyn's analytical, but sheltered upbringing, and the two of them working in tandem proved vital in taking down
Silco's
criminal empire.

Abilities
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Brawler:
Having been trained by
Vander
, Vi is highly skilled at hand-to-hand combat, being able to dodge and counter most punches, even those from
shimmer
-enhanced individuals. She would use her fighting skills in tandem with her gauntlets.
Iron Gauntlets:
Made from iron cast metal with a flat surface area, she used Vander's signature weapons while training as well as when rescuing him from the old cannery.
Atlas Gauntlets:
Exceedingly rare and powerful
hextech
prototype gloves created by
Jayce
and
Viktor
as a tool to allow miners in the fissures to work more efficiently and without fatigue. Having repurposed them as boxing gloves, the Atlas gauntlets considerably boost Vi's strength and dexterity, and can even form a
shield
around her body to defend herself. The gauntlets also have powerful
rocket boosters
built into them, which allow Vi to launch herself forward through the air.
Leader:
Learning from her adoptive father Vander, Vi became a competent leader for her small group of sumpsnipes, later inspiring
Ekko
to follow in her footsteps.
Parkour:
Being extremely athletic, Vi has no difficulties scaling rooftops and returning to Zaun from Piltover through an unconventional method by jumping off a cliff to running across a steel beam.
Lockpicking:
After her time in Stillwater, Vi eventually learned how to pick locks, allowing her to break free from handcuffs with ease.

Jinx
[
edit

edit source
]


Violet
and
Powder
were sisters who grew up together under the care of
Vander
after their parents' deaths. Vi was overprotective of her sister, defending her when she'd be teased, most often by
Mylo
. She was Powder's biggest supporter when they were young; they often sat together looking at gadgets Powder had made, and Vi would encourage her that they would someday work. After
Vander
was kidnapped, Vi wanted to protect Powder from getting hurt, but Powder believed this meant Vi had no faith in her and suffered a mental breakdown. Her efforts to prove Vi wrong would end up killing their entire family, and the horrific accident led Vi to snap and call Powder a 'jinx' before walking away from her to clear her head. Although Vi had always intended to return to Powder, she was arrested by
Marcus
, separating the sisters for years without reconciliation.
As adults, Vi and her sister would reunite, but their bond had been irrevocably changed. Vi was disturbed to learn the Powder had been adopted by
Silco
, working for him and adopting the name "Jinx." Vi believed that Silco had brainwashed her with his manipulations, and she decided to destroy him as way of bringing "Powder" back. Jinx, meanwhile, became jealous of Vi's budding relationship with
Caitlyn
, feeling insulted and paranoid that her sister would choose to spend time with an Enforcer instead of her. Though they still cared for one another, the deep traumas and misunderstandings from their childhoods continued to drive a wedge between the sisters until Jinx would eventually cut ties with Vi, burying "Powder" and fully-embracing "Jinx" after Silco's death. After Jinx's actions continued to lead to more suffering, Vi told herself that her sister was dead, and that "Jinx" had killed her. She joined the Enforcers as a result, and feeling the other had betrayed them, the two became bitter enemies.
Despite everything, Vi still loved her sister. Whenever Vi had the chance to kill Jinx, she always hesitated, repeatedly being unable to finish her, even when Jinx requested for Vi to kill her. The two managed to mend their relationship again when they discovered their father Vander was alive within
Warwick
, and their joint efforts to save him briefly restored hope that they could all be a family again, with Vi even starting to respect her sister's wishes to be called by her preferred name. This was short-lived, however, and when they lost Vander, Jinx attempted to cut Vi out of her life again, demanding that Vi should give up on her and go be happy with Caitlyn instead. This was seemingly done to protect Vi, but Vi interpreted it as a betrayal, claiming that she was a fool for deciding to trust her. Later on, Jinx returned to save Vi's life during
Ambessa's
invasion, where she reassured her sister that was always with her, even when they were "worlds apart." Jinx would apparently sacrifice herself to save Vi from Warwick, and Vi cried out in anguish, unable to watch the explosion below her.

Caitlyn Kiramman
[

edit source
]


Vi and Caitlyn share a deep and intimate relationship. Having been the one who freed her from prison, Caitlyn was directly responsible for changing Vi's viewpoint of all Piltovans, showing her kindness and care she never got from topside. Caitlyn's kindness and concern over her would lead Vi into giving Caitlyn the nickname of "Cupcake", which Caitlyn would eventually take to heart. She would be the only person Vi would emotionally open up to, telling her about her past and current concerns. Both Vi and Caitlyn were greatly protective of each other, protecting each other's back and saving each other's lives when necessary, and this relationship would only grow closer with time.
However, their relationship would become complicated by the fact that Vi was the sister of
Jinx
, whom Caitlyn considered to be a dangerous and unhinged lunatic who needed to be put down for Piltover's safety. Vi's unwillingness to let her sister get hurt by anyone, even for the greater good, led Caitlyn to hesitate the first time she had a chance to kill her, directly leading to the death of her own mother. After this, Caitlyn made it her mission to destroy Jinx, burying many of the characteristics that had led Vi to fall in love with her in the first place, and eventually, Caitlyn's quest would lead her to even abandon Vi, leaving her heartbroken.
When Vi and Caitlyn met again after many months, they reconnected quickly, having both grown unhappy with their lives in the other's absence. While their decisions to respectively associate with Jinx and
Ambessa
still led to friction and arguments between them, they ultimately reaffirmed their love for one another, with Vi not even caring that Caitlyn was currently seeing
someone else
at the time. The two of them are currently in a romantic relationship, with Vi seemingly living with Caitlyn in the Kiramman mansion and always ready to accompany her anywhere.

Warwick
[
edit

edit source
]


Vander
was an old friend of Vi's mother
Felicia
, and he had been the one who helped her choose the name Violet. After Felicia's death on the Bridge of Progress, Vander took in Vi and her sister
Powder
as his own daughters. He taught them both to live a better life, guiding Vi to be a better person than himself. He taught her how to punch, passing down his brawler skills in order for her to properly protect herself on the streets.
When Vi was a teenager, she could not understand why Vander prohibited the undercity from stealing from topside, as Piltover was a city of abundance and would send Enforcers to intrude in the undercity's affairs. To prove herself capable, Vi would eventually break Vander's rule, and when she returned from her failed heist he scolded her for not understanding the responsibilities that come with leadership. When Vi learned about Vander's secret deal with the Enforcers, she felt betrayed and confronted him about it, after which Vander told Vi that like her, he thought he could change things through violence, but he only ever made more problems, and that he now blamed himself for her parents' deaths as a result of their failed uprising. Vi took Vander's lesson to heart and later tried to turn herself in. Vander stopped Vi and went in her place, which led to his kidnapping and eventual downfall at the hands of
Silco
, where he seemingly died trying to rescue her. Vi tried to prevent Vander's death every step of the way, and her failure to do so led her to such anguish that she briefly turned on her sister, despite Vander's final words being to "take care of Powder." Vi would never forgive herself for this moment, seeing it as a betrayal of both her sister and of Vander's trust in her.
In the following years, Vi continued Vander's legacy by following his teachings, incorporating his signature gauntlet brawling techniques into her fighting style. Whenever she was in a tough position, she would envision Vander supporting her to not give up. Unbeknownst to her, however, Vander was actually still alive, his mind and body twisted into the savage chemtech beast known as
Warwick
. When Vi learned of this, she initially believed it was one of
Jinx's
delusions, but decided to entertain Jinx's fantasy so she could see for herself. When the beast attacked them, Vi's voice managed to reawaken Vander's memories, and she would try desperately to bring him back fully. Unfortunately, these efforts would lead them to
Viktor
, who betrayed Vi's trust by transforming Warwick into one of his evolved puppets, erasing her father once again.
During the battle at the Hexgate, Vi reluctantly fought the mindless shell of her father until the Herald was defeated, after which Vander collapsed to the ground, motionless. The sight of Vander's lifeless form reminded Vi of the day she had originally lost him, and she began to sob uncontrollably. When Warwick woke up in a savage state and started to attack her, Vi found herself unable to escape and she had to be saved by her sister, and Vi ended up losing them both.

Mylo
and
Claggor
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Mylo and Claggor were Vi's adoptive brothers under
Vander's
care, and they often accompanied her in heists as her sidekicks. She respected them for their street skills—Claggor for his strength and Mylo for his lockpicking—and they both looked up to her greatly and followed her orders. Between the two of them, Vi would sometimes argue with Mylo, who annoyed her with his inability to keep his mouth shut in certain situations and his constant ridicule of her younger sister,
Powder
. Mylo and Claggor were later killed by Powder's monkey bomb, and she presumably mourned them both during her time at Stillwater.
Years after Mylo and Claggor's deaths, Vi would recover Claggor's goggles from
Jinx
as she was following her trail as an Enforcer. After collecting the goggles, Vi wore them on her head as an accessory to her uniform, likely as a token to remember him by.

Ekko
[
edit

edit source
]

Ekko saw Vi as a mentor and an older sister, seeing her as fearless and the "toughest person in all of
Zaun
."
[
20
]
She would teach him how to be tougher and confident in himself, training him in some of her fighting moves while also comforting him when he needed it. Ekko tried to follow Vi's example after she was presumed dead, starting up a gang that would protect the undercity. After establishing the
Firelights
, there would be a mural of Vi in their hideout in honor of a friend he thought he lost.
Years later, Ekko found out that Vi was alive. However, after years of
Silco
corrupting nearly everyone, including Vi's sister
Jinx
, Ekko was made wary of outsiders, which caused him to doubt if Vi could be trusted, especially since she was associating with an enforcer named Caitlyn. Ekko took the time to vet Vi by spying on her from afar and eventually kidnap her and Caitlyn in order to assess if they could be trusted. When Ekko went to interrogate Vi, Vi revealed she had escaped her restraints and could have escaped anytime she wanted. Vi then assured him that she was on his side and told him she was proud of how much he'd grown up, winning back his trust. Vi vouched for Caitlyn, who convinced Ekko to work with Piltover to take down Silco. Although Ekko went with Caitlyn and Vi to reveal Silco's conspiracy and give back the hextech gemstone, they were attacked by by the Enforcers and eventually Jinx as well. Ekko stayed behind to hold off Jinx while he entrusted Caitlyn and Vi to escape to Piltover and gain their support in stopping Silco.
Vi and Ekko would meet again during
Ambessa's
invasion of Piltover, when he and Jinx arrived to support the Piltovan war effort. When Jinx was attacked by
Warwick
, Vi and Ekko rushed to save her on his hoverboard. After the battle, the two of them both mourned Jinx separately, but they are presumably still on good terms.

Piltover Enforcers
[
edit
|
edit source
]

The Enforcers were responsible for the deaths of Vi's parents,
Felicia
and
Connol
, and as a result, she hated them from a young age. As a teenager, Vi always felt the urge to fight back against
Piltover
for what they had done, but
Vander
challenged her perspective by telling her about war and bloodshed and accepting the blame for her parents' deaths. After she was brought to Stillwater, Vi suffered harsh treatment at the Enforcers' hands, but did not show any signs of fear around them, putting on a disobedient and carefree demeanor. She knew many in the organization were secretly working for
Silco
, and later worked with
Caitlyn
to expose this corruption to the Council. Vi's distrust of the Enforcers led her to distrust Caitlyn at first as well, but Caitlyn later convinced her that some simply wanted to do good for the city. Vi later joined the Enforcers at Caitlyn's request; albeit reluctantly, and only because she felt a responsibility for stopping her sister,
Jinx
. She left during the martial law period, but returned to aid in the battle at the Hexgate. While she continues to work closely with Caitlyn, it is unknown if she officially rejoined their ranks.

Loris
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Vi and Loris met by the side of the road in
Piltover
, where she found him drunk and decided to join him after turning down an offer to join the
Piltover Enforcers
. The two became acquaintances and later squadmates after the attack on the Councilors Memorial, when
Caitlyn
selected them both as members of her strike team into
Zaun
. Here, Vi and Loris worked closely together as they took on
chembarons
and eluded
Jinx's
traps. After the declaration of martial law, both Vi and Loris had parted ways with Caitlyn (for different reasons), but the two of them remained drinking buddies as Vi went on to become a cage fighting champion. Loris was supportive of Vi and frequented her matches, and Vi appeared fond of him. Even so, Vi's breakup with Caitlyn took a hard toll on her mental health, and after Vi lashed out at another bar patron and got into a heated argument with Loris, he left her to sort out her life out alone. After Vi was wounded during the destruction of
Viktor's
commune, Loris watched over Vi's bedside to make sure she made a smooth recovery, and then informed her about Jinx's arrest. They both fought together to defend the Hexgate against
Ambessa's
invasion, where Loris would suddenly and unfortunately be killed in the heat of battle.

Maddie
and
Steb
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Maddie and Steb first met Vi before the memorial service, where she and
Loris
were both drunk by the side of the road. Maddie had gotten word about how Vi had bravely taken
Silco
all on her own and claimed to be an admirer of hers, saying she was glad
Caitlyn
had gotten a badge so she could join them. During
Renni's
attack, Vi helped the Enforcers fight them off, and she would later join them on Caitlyn strike team to eliminate the remnants of Silco's empire. As squadmates, they worked closely together, but Vi became concerned for their safety as they closed in on
Jinx
and convinced Caitlyn to send them home. While Maddie would eventually be exposed as a traitor during
Ambessa's
invasion of Piltover, Steb remained loyal to the Enforcers and would survive the battle. Vi presumably remains on good terms with Steb.

Silco
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Vi saw Silco as a criminal and a murderer, as it was his kidnapping of
Vander
that led to the failed rescue mission that would destroy her entire family. In Stillwater, Vi frequently beat up any of Silco's goons who got sent there, even when they weren't provoking her. Vi's resentment for Silco only deepended when she learned he had adopted
Powder
as his daughter, and that under his care she had become a violent criminal known as
Jinx
. Vi initially believed Powder had changed as a result of Silco's manipulations of her, and tried to bring down his criminal empire by force, even when everyone else had seemingly given up the fight. In turn, Silco had believed for years that Vi was dead, and preferred she stay dead so that Jinx would not leave his side. Their hatred for one another came to a head at Jinx's tea party, where Silco accused Vi of lying to Jinx while claiming that he was her true family, as Vi had abandoned her all those years ago, and later tried to kill her with Jinx's pistol. Since Vi blamed herself for leaving Powder, she had no argument when her sister had claimed that she was the one who created Jinx instead of Silco. The encounter would end in Silco's death, but the victory was his, as Jinx fully abandoned her life as Powder and cut ties with Vi.

Sevika
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Though originally agreeing with Sevika's mindset that Vander was being "weak" by not fighting back against topside, Vi eventually resented Sevika for betraying Vander and siding with Silco, which led to his eventual downfall. When she was freed from prison, Vi quickly tracked Sevika down and fought her without asking any questions beforehand, and they quickly became rivals. Vi would lose their first fight when she got stabbed, but would win the second one, besting Sevika in barroom brawl and destroying her cybernetic arm. The two would remain enemies after Silco's death, with Sevika working with Jinx and Vi working with Caitlyn. During Ambessa's invasion, Sevika would arrive to support the Piltovan war effort, presumably at Jinx's request. After the battle, Sevika earned a seat on the Piltover Council and presumably holds some level of influence over Piltovan law enforcement. It is unknown if they are still enemies.

Jayce Talis
[
edit
|
edit source
]

While Vi unofficially met Jayce during her escape from his workshop, they would not truly know who the other was until years later. Vi would formally meet Jayce during a Piltover Council meeting where she tried to enlist their help against Silco, and viewing him as the only Councilor willing to help her in her cause, she tracked Jayce down to his forge to recruit him into a raid on
Silco's
shimmer
factory. Even though the act unsanctioned, Jayce agreed to her plan and gave Vi her signature
Atlas gauntlets
to use as a weapon. During the raid, they showed coordinated teamwork in defeating chemtank thugs. However, Jayce would quickly have second thoughts about starting a war with Silco when he accidentally killed a Zaunite child. Vi believed Jayce's doubts were naive, as countless children had already died as a result of Piltover's negligence. After a brief argument, Vi refused to return the gauntlets, and Jayce decided he was unwilling to fight her for them. Vi then went to continue her fight against Silco without Jayce's help.
After they had went their separate ways, Vi and Jayce would meet again in Piltover during the memorial service for the fallen Council members, where they were both attacked by the
chembaron
Renni
, who had come to avenge her son, who was the child Jayce had killed. Though Jayce had been injured by Renni, they again managed to work together to fend off the attack, which convinced Jayce to develop of new
hextech
weapons to support Vi and Caitlyn's strike team into Zaun. The two remained allies when Jayce and Caitlyn led the defense of Piltover against
Ambessa
and
Viktor
.

Isha
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Vi first encountered Isha during her battle against
Jinx
, where the young girl put herself between them and aimed Jinx's
pistol
at Vi's head. Isha seemed initially unaware that Vi and Jinx were sisters and appeared ready to kill her, despite being afraid of her. Isha's fear of Vi and love for Jinx led Vi to have second thoughts about killing Jinx right away, and she prevented
Caitlyn
from taking the shot, explaining that she might miss and hit Isha.
Isha and Vi met again during Jinx's search for
Warwick
. In the mines, Vi got into a fistfight with Jinx, and when Isha intervened Vi accidentally hit her, giving her a bloody nose. Realizing she had hurt the girl, Vi quickly ended the fight, which allowed her to see a different side of Jinx as she rushed over and showed concern for Isha's safety. After recovering Vander's memories within Warwick, Isha joined Vi and Jinx in their family hug, and Vi did not protest. Vi eventually witnessed Isha's sacrifice at the commune and stopped Jinx from running to save her, as she realized the explosion would have killed them both.

Viktor
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Vi and
Jinx
approached Viktor as a means to bring back
Vander's
mind out from within the
beast
, having received word of his reputation as a miracle healer. Though Jinx appeared skeptical Viktor would be able to help, Vi appeared more hopeful and actively discussed the details of their visit with the Herald, with his one condition being that Vander be restrained at night for the safety of his commune. Vi appeared to enjoy staying in Viktor's commune, and even believed that she, Jinx, and Vander could begin a new life in his underground utopia once Vander was brought back. However, Viktor would eventually betray Vi's trust when he joined forces with
Singed
and
Ambessa
and began a transfusion that erased Vander's memories, deliberately going back on his promise to them. Viktor would then transform Vander into one of his evolved puppets and controlled him directly against Vi and her sister in the battle at the Hexgate.

Ambessa Medarda
[
edit
|
edit source
]

Vi does not respect Ambessa, referring to her as a "self-serving war pig" and blaming her for manipulating
Caitlyn
for months. Fearing what Ambessa's army was capable of, Vi took steps to try and protect
Vander
from her, which led her back to Caitlyn. When Caitlyn had seemingly captured and brought Vi to Ambessa's tent, the warlord believed Vi's talents would make her a good fit for her army, but believed Vi needed to be killed since Caitlyn would be "distracted" by her reappearance. Vi, however, was a step ahead of Ambessa and managed to escape and subdue her, before sarcastically remarking that she hoped she was worth her time. Vi would later oppose Ambessa's army twice—first her attack on the commune, and then at her attack on the Hexgate.
