Early Life
[

edit source

Skarner was born to the legendary brackern broodmother Nixalẹ alongside many other bracklings in his brood. While most left to form their own clans, Skarner remained alongside Nixalẹ to study her power and wisdom out of curiosity, giving him the opportunity to hone his elemental geomancy and learn how to feel underground vibrations to detect movement across the earth.

Founding of the Yun Tal

When he got older, he felt a dramatic shift as humans
came to the land to found their settlement
now known as
Ixtal
. While most of Clan Ọ̀pal-hin distrusted the humans, Skarner was curious to learn more about them. He silently observed their civilization, noticing how they made the most of their lives creating and innovating before passing away. Believing the subjects of his curiosity to be fragile, he intervened to save them from a rockslide that would destroy their settlement, earning him their worship towards him as their protector. Believing his protection was the only way they could survive, Skarner made it his duty to guard the Ixtali while also shaping the earth to create new plots for them to expand their civilization, and in return they shared their culture. He was one of the founding members of the
Yun Tal
, a ruling caste dedicated to leading the Ixtali to a brighter future.

Isolation Beneath Ixaocan

As the protector of Ixtal, Skarner listened to the earth's vibrations for any threats to the nation, the most concerning being the encroaching Shuriman Empire. Eventually, the forces of
Shurima
would arrive at Ixtal and offered them an opportunity to form an alliance. The Yun Tal accepted, despite Skarner's protest, due his distrust of their lust for power. After Shurima collapsed as the result of the
Icathian
rebellion, Ixtal had regained its independence, but Skarner was left distrustful towards the world outside Ixtal. His fears worsened after witnessing the destruction caused by the
Rune Wars
, eventually convincing the Yun Tal to isolate Ixtal from the rest of the world. Left bitter towards the Yun Tal's failure to protect Ixtal, he decided that he would be Ixtal's sole protector, creating an underground chamber beneath Ixaocan to amplify the vibrational threads around the continent so he could always sense any potential threats. Eventually, he decided to stay in his chamber permanently, but as newer generations of Ixtali started to question their civilization's self-isolation, Skarner's paranoia began to grow. Believing that ending their isolation would lead to disastrous consequences for Ixtal, Skarner swore to protect Ixtal no matter the cost, even if it meant their destruction.

Appearance

Skarner is a kaiju-sized scorpion-like creature with six legs, a pair of thick grasping pincers, and three long tails ending in stingers. He has a teal and white carapace decorated with orange, teal, and white paint. His head is vaguely human-like despite its chitinous exterior, having two glowing teal eyes and a hinged jaw and mouth, but with two insect-like mandibles. He wears (relatively) small decorative ornaments on his upper arms and central tail.

Personality
[

Skarner is a commanding and imposing presence, speaking with the authority of an ancient, powerful being. Still, he carries an aura of formality, wisdom, and solemnity. He is single-mindedly protective of
Ixtal
, seeing himself as its steward and most important protector. Though he cares greatly for mortals, he is keenly aware of their flaws and weaknesses, seemingly having little faith in them. Thus, he is extremely stubborn, prioritizing his own judgment above that of all others. He is absolutely certain that Ixtal should remain in isolation and is growing increasingly paranoid as more Ixtali begin to question their nation's solitude.
