Early Life

Zyra existed thousands of years ago as a collective hive-mind of carnivorous plants that lived together in a place called
Gardens of Zyr
, somewhere in the
Shuriman
jungle. Sometime during the
Rune Wars
, a party of soldiers accompanied by an ambitious sorceress visited the garden and were attacked by the plants. In an act of fear, the sorceress unleashed a magical attack that ignited the fumes of the swamp, causing a magical explosion that destroyed everything in its path. The gardens remained lifeless for hundreds of years after.

Contemporary history

After centuries without life in the gardens, Zyra emerged from the lifeless ground, not fully plant nor fully human. She struggled to understand her new existence and came to be curious of the new world she was able to explore.
Her plants seem to be slowly expanding westward towards the
Mother of Life
river system of the
Shurima Capital
.

With the Flowers

Zyra's flowers were collected by a flower shop in the market city of
Kumangra
. The owner watered one of the flowers and placed it in his study. From the flower bloomed a large mass of vines and flowers that covered the entire study and wrapped the shop owner into a cocoon, killing him. After the shop owner's wife found him, Zyra appeared in the study, stopping the wife from destroying the flower and wrapping her in a cocoon, killing her. As the woman died, she saw visions of a world covered in Zyra's plants with nothing else in sight.

Zyra is a wondrous vision of a creature, resembling a human woman covered with plants, which seem to be parts of her body. Her eyes are very similar to a panther's, with narrow irises that are common to predators.

Personality

Zyra is a vicious, predatory creature. In spite of gaining human intelligence, Zyra still has the natural instinct of consuming and devouring of a vicious predator. Her ultimate goal is to envelop the world with her plants, making it beautiful and ridding it of all that isn't her.
