Early Life
[

edit source
]

Neeko is a
vastaya
born in the
Oovi-Kat
tribe, who lived on a
remote island
far to the east of
Valoran
. The Oovi-Kat retained most of their ancient heritage, tracing their lineage back to the
vastayashai'rei
â€”the ancestors of all vastaya. The Oovi-Kat lived in a peaceful and harmonious paradise that blended into the
spirit realm
. Because of this, the Oovi-Kat had a talent in sensing the
Sho'ma
, or 'soul' of living beings, creating a society free of secrets. Neeko grew up in this tribe with a fondness for games and trinkets, growing a sense of innocence and curiosity for all things.

Cataclysm

When an undisclosed cataclysm devastated the Oovi-Kat, the elders of the tribe sacrificed themselves to allow some of the remaining vastaya to escape with their lives. Neeko, being among them, took the form of a bird and fled the smoldering destruction as her home faded into the border between realms.
Days later, Neeko became exhausted and clung to a plank of driftwood in the
Eternal Ocean
. She eventually came across a mercantile vessel travelling for
Harelport
and crept aboard, resting where she could and calling into the spirit realm for her tribe. The only response she could get were scattered echoes and images of dead trees laying over the horizon.

Arrival In Harelport

When the vessel arrived in the city, Neeko emerged in an unfamiliar world bustling with unique personalities and shapes that were completely alien to her. Neeko became entranced with curiosity and wandered with awe, eventually being spotted by a vastayan sailor named Krete. He demanded to know what tribe she was a member of and, in response, Neeko reached into his Sho'ma and mimicked his appearance; an expression of friendliness and peace in Oovi-Kat culture. Krete became offended and frightened by Neeko's shapeshifting and, overwhelmed by his thoughts, Neeko fled into the crowd.

Encounter with Nidalee

Neeko eventually traveled out of Harelport and into the lush jungles of
Ixtal
. Seeking solace, she spotted a pack of
pakaa
from the trees; fierce and majestic jungle cats native to the forests. By taking their form, Neeko ran with them across the jungles. While enjoying this cougar-like form she took, the leader of this pack unexpectedly shapeshifted into a seemingly
human
woman named
Nidalee
. After a tense standoff, Nidalee reluctantly accepted Neeko into her pack.
Living within the pack, Neeko and Nidalee became inseparable as some sort of relationship blossomed between them, feeling a deep sense of kinship for Nidalee. For months, Nidalee enjoyed mentoring Neeko in the art of survival within the jungles and the two enjoyed wandering the wilds together.

Though Neeko began to feel intense romantic feelings for her new friend, these feelings went mostly unrequited, though still blossoming with lots of potential.
Though Nidalee despised the towns and cities of the civilized people, Neeko constantly felt an urge to curiously explore them and she longed to explore more of the world outside of the jungles. One night, Neeko's Oovi-Kat ancestors came to her in a dream, showing her the pale branches of dead trees and acting as an omen of warning to Neeko of the danger her people are in. With this, Neeko vowed to recreate the Oovi-Kat as an entirely new tribe of her own, wishing to venture out to pursue this personal journey. Though she urged Nidalee to join her, she could not be persuaded and the two parted ways to follow their own quests.

Modern History
[

Neeko continued her journey to rebuild the Oovi-Kat in her own way, welcoming all beings whether they be like-hearted vastaya,
yordles
, humans and other creatures. Those that join her tribe are easily befriended by Neeko, who in turn vows to defend their sho'ma with her own life.
While travelling, Neeko found herself at a
Noxian
Outpost at
Kalduga
. Curious to see if the Noxians were friendly, she snuck into the outpost and took the form of Ewaii, one of the patrolling soldiers at the outpost. While disguised, Ewaii's commander Yubbers began to yell commands at Neeko under the impression that she was in fact Ewaii.
Neeko then took a mote of Yubber's sho'ma, shifting her shape into his and confusing the soldiers even more. Eventually, Neeko got caught by the actual Yubbers and disappeared into a crowd of people while changing her shape. Mayhem ensued as the guards began to accuse one another and kill each other out of fear as Neeko snuck away. The soldiers abandoned the outpost completely, each going their separate ways and uncertainty of who was secretly Neeko all along.

At some point, Neeko got captured by a band of
Piltovan
poachers led by
7
Captain Rowain
. These poachers sought to catch and eventually sell exotic creatures of the jungles in hopes of making a large profit. A scientist who had been hired by the poachers named
3
Anura
, alongside her pet frog Froop, felt sympathy for the captured vastaya and devised a massive escape plan to free her.

Successfully freed from her capture by the poachers, Neeko found herself back in the jungles and reunited with her old friend Nidalee. Neeko warned Nidalee of the poachers and the two planned to drive them out of the jungle. Under the cover of night, Nidalee and Neeko ambushed the poachers' encampment alongside the rest of the pakaa pack and some
6
other wildlife
, driving them out of the forests.

Neeko is a female vastaya that has a teen-like appearance and some characteristics of a chameleon, like scales and reptile eyes. She has very colorful hair with glands sprouting out of her head which she uses to capture others' Sho'ma. She wears tribal clothes and walks barefoot.

Personality
[

]

Neeko has a very jovial and fun-going personality. She is somewhat innocent and unaware the dangers that surround her. She does not comprehend most of human society and relationships, and some of the words, so she usually creates chaotic scenarios thanks to her naivety.

Abilities
[

edit source
]

Vastayan Physiology:
Neeko is a Vastaya, an ancient race of demi-humans changed by magic of the
Spirit Realm
. This connection to the Spirit Realm has increased their longevity and granted them powerful magics, allowing them to live for centuries. Neeko is a member of the Oovi-Kat tribe of vastaya; reptilian vastaya that resemble chameleons.
Spiritual Magic:
Because the Oovi-Kat retained most of their heritage directly connected to the
Vastayashai'rei
, Neeko has strong ties to the Spirit Realm and access to lots of magical abilities tied to it. She can utilize this is many different ways, such as firing
blasts of energy
at her opponent, restraining enemies with
vine-like energies
or creating a burst of colorful flowers to damage and blind enemies.
Shapeshifting:
By reaching into a person's
Sho'ma
, or their 'soul' according to Oovi-Kat culture, Neeko can instantly take the appearance of any being who has a soul. When Neeko shapeshifts into someone, she can tap into their inner feelings and memories but is unable to access their abilities.
Spiritual Reading:
Neeko can inherently see the
Sho'ma
of living beings, or their 'soul.' Because of this, she can sense the inner feelings of beings around her and can see the true intentions and emotions of others, granting her a strong sense of empathy.
Illusion Creation:
Neeko can create perfect duplicates of herself that last for a short amount of time before fizzling away, allowing her to deceive and confuse opponents.
