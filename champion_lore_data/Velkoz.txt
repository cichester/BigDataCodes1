One of the first Voidborn, created by the hands of the
Watchers
, who has been known by many names but the ancient
Shurimans
named it Vel'Koz, or "to understand by unmaking". Vel'Koz was created to watch, listen and learn from the living, so the Watchers could know best how to destroy them. And so Vel'Koz did, silently observing the various landscapes of Runeterra, watching as civilizations rise and fall. Now and again it travels back through the great rifts in the fabric of Runeterra, back into the Void to relay everything it has seen before promptly returning back to the goal of its existance.
But to understand, sometimes requires unmaking. Vel'Koz often leaves towns empty, with no sign of struggles except for the withered husks of its former residents, with a distinct dark pit where their left eye would be; a wound left by Vel'Koz's devouring of knowledge.

Fairly recently, Vel'Koz has been sighted in the region of
Tokogol
where it destroyed the region's namesake village.

Appearance
[

Vel'Koz is a floating, otherworldly creature, composed almost entirely of three tentacles and a single, massive eye.  His central eye is a glowing, violet orb with a dark, catlike pupil, though he also seems to have three smaller eyes protruding from stalks. His tentacles are dark turquoise at the base, fading into bright violet at the tips. He wears a pale, golden armor over his frame.

Personality
[

As a
Voidborn
, Vel'Koz is shown to be extremely dispassionate towards the denizens of
Runeterra
. He has zero empathy for the people he studies and executes his tasks with cold and calculated efficiency. However, unlike other
Voidborn
, Vel'Koz is not obsessed with destruction or consuming the world around him but instead to observe and collect information about the world of
Runeterra
. This puts his seemingly-cruel approach in a different light, as it appears his experiments are borne solely out of curiosity. To that end, accumulating knowledge seems to be his only drive, and he does this by annihilating the subjects of his study.

Abilities

Voidborn
:
Vel'Koz is a Voidborn, a being birthed from the Void to enter the material realm. Because the Void possesses different laws of reality, Voidborn have to create new bodies from the matter of Runeterra.
Knowledge Absorption:
Vel'Koz can absorb the knowledge of other living beings by inserting one of his tentacles inside of them. By absorbing the knowledge of other living beings, he leaves them as nothing more than withered husks.
Void Energy Emission:
Vel'Koz can emit powerful beams of Void energy from both his tentacles and his eye. He can control the intensity of these beams from small surgical cuts to massive blasts of destructive power.
Levitation:
Vel'Koz generally moves by floating above the ground.
Tentacles:
Vel'Koz can use the tentacles to smash, grip, and crush foes as well as project void energy.

Kassadin
seeks to keep the Voidborn from crossing over to
Runeterra
and thus is his enemy (and a nice research subject).
Malzahar
on the other hand seeks to facilitate the crossing and thus is his ally (Vel'Koz is no stranger to killing other Voidborn who might destroy his research materials, though).
