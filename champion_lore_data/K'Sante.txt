Early Life
[
edit

edit source
]

K'Sante was born in the
Shuriman
city of
Nazumah
, a city-state independent from the rule of the Shuriman emperor
Azir
and home to a culture based around hunting ferocious monsters that roamed the oasis. Inspired by his parents' teachings and stories of Nazumah's history, K'Sante dreamt of becoming his homeland's greatest warrior-hunter. For twenty years, K'Sante trained under the tutelage of several teachers, learning how to extract materials from beasts and craft them into weaponry and infrastructure. During his first years of hunting, K'Sante formed a close friendship with a fellow hunter named
Tope
, who fought alongside him as they hunted
5
rockbear
herds, shakkal raiders and even some
Xer'Sai
. The two formed a close bond over the years and K'Sante eventually confessed his love for Tope, who in turn revealed that the feelings were mutual as the two shared their first kiss.

Hunt of the Cobra-Lion

With the
resurrection of Azir
,
Xerath
waged a violent crusade to take over Shurima and eradicate Azir's bloodline. The two
Ascended
waged battles against one another with monstrous forces and Nazumah was caught in the crossfire. Xerath, experimenting with a Sun Disc of his own, attempted to use its powers of
Ascension
to empower and fuse Shuriman fauna together, producing
Baccai
monsters. One such creature, a hybrid between a cobra and a lion, began terrorizing a nearby savannah and alerted K'Sante and Tope, who both vowed to hunt down and kill the cobra-lion. Unfortunately, they were unable to wound the creature due to its rapidly regenerating hide, forcing them to flee emptyhanded. The two trained to slay the cobra-lion and made various other attempts to kill the beast to no avail. Tope spent his time formulating strategies and studying how to weaken the beast's regenerative properties, making some progress by chipping away a portion of its hide. K'Sante was unsatisfied by the development however, getting lost in his prideful pursuit for glory in killing the creature. His pride got so problematic that that he began to look down on Tope, accusing him of holding him back from a successful hunt. The two argued over their differing methods of how to defeat the cobra-lion until they had a falling out, separating as lovers and going their separate ways.
K'Sante spent the next year training and trying to defeat the cobra-lion by himself but would keep failing, causing him to come to terms with his inability to slay the beast by himself. With that, he gained the courage to seek Tope's help and travelled to his home only to find Tope's aunt instead. His aunt greeted K'Sante and revealed that her nephew had left Nazumah and returned to his hometown in
Marrowmark
shortly after their separation. However, she handed K'Sante one of Tope's journals, stating that he left it behind to assist him on finally slaying the cobra-lion one day. K'Sante thoroughly studied Tope's journal and read his theories on the beast's true nature as a Baccai, theorizing that the magical properties of Nazumah's natural waters could weaken the beast's regenerating armor. K'Sante remembered his parents' teachings, realizing he had grown too prideful of himself and failed to respect Tope's ideas. Accepting his mistakes and finding a newfound respect for his former lover, K'Sante set off to slay the cobra-lion once and for all.
Beneath a scarlet sky, K'Sante had a final battle against the beast, taking a more calculated approach and dodging its attacks while striking when its guard was lowered. As his body was bloodied and his weapons were shattered, the beast finally tired and K'Sante saw an opportunity to strike the final blow. Inspired by Tope's theories, he lured the cobra-lion into a Nazuman waterfall, weakening its armor in the natural waters and finally slaying the beast.

His victory was celebrated and he donated the Baccai's body to be studied under Nazuman tradition. The only parts of the beast that he kept were two slabs of its hide, crafting them into his signature ntofos and specially engineered to utilize the beast's regenerative properties. In his ntofos, K'Sante also carved a lion's head, the symbol Tope used to represent the beast in his journal, as a way to honor his partner's hand in slaying the beast even after their relationship ended.

Modern History

After his victorious hunt of the cobra-lion, K'Sante was hailed as the
Pride of Nazumah,
and the city-state was so grateful that they planned a major celebration to place his name within their esteemed
Hunter's Hall,
where the greatest hunters of Nazumah were honored for their great deeds and victorious hunts.
As the Pride of Nazumah, K'Sante acts as the guardian of his city, defending it from other monstrous beasts, raiders and even the battling forces of the Ascended such as Azir and Xerath's followers.

Reunion with Tope

Outside of Nazumah, K'Sante battled against a group of mad zealots following Xerath. K'Sante fought them off despite his severe injuries, slowly being overwhelmed by the amount of zealots. Unexpectedly, he was saved by a mysterious, masked warrior armed with a bow and leading a group of archers, all of them wearing a striking green and gold outfit. K'Sante fought alongside these archers and they effortlessly defeated the raiders, to which the masked warrior revealed himself as Tope, K'Sante's former lover. Impressed by K'Sante's combat and entertained by their reunion together, Tope invited K'Sante to his hunting group's camp nearby, offering to heal his injuries. K'Sante initially refused, but quickly succumbed to his intense injuries and collapsed on the ground, falling unconscious.
Two days later, K'Sante woke up in the camp, greeted by Tope waiting near his bed. Tope explains how, over the past few months, the Ascended have been sending their armies farther down south, encroaching on territories such as Marrowmark and Nazumah. The two bonded over a meal and talked about their current lives, reminiscing on their past relationship and how far they've come since then. Tope reveals that he is now a commander for his own Marrowmarkman hunting party, while K'Sante invites Tope to attend the celebration of his name being placed in Nazumah's Hunter's Hall. Tope, grateful for the invite, refuses due to the fact that he is getting married around the same time. K'Sante, surprised and slightly flustered, feels genuine happiness for Tope and congratulates him on his marriage.
As the two talk more about their past, Tope recalled their falling out years ago and apologized for not supporting K'Sante enough during the hunt for the cobra-lion. K'Sante quickly interjected and objected to Tope's apology, stating that
he
has to apologize for how badly his pride took over and how he hurt Tope by disregarding his strategies. After that, the two make a toast, wishing each other the best of luck on their paths and feeling a deeper sense of friendship and love for one another.

Personality
[

edit source
]

K'Sante is a determined and ambitious individual who grew up with a deep reverence for his homeland and a desire to become its greatest warrior-hunter thanks to the many stories he heard as a child. He is fiercely independent and believes that he must prove himself through his own strength and achievements, but often refuses to accept help or support from others. This intense drive and pride in his own abilities lead him to dismiss the ideas and strategies of his partner, Tope, ultimately straining their relationship.
Now, K'Sante remains incredibly ambitious and passionate about his own nation. He speaks with lots of confidence and fearlessness especially on a hunt. Though he still sometimes struggles with humbling himself for the sake of others, he is actively aware of not letting his own hubris take over.
As it is in Nazuman culture, K'Sante does not follow any of the
Ascended
and has a strong opposition towards them. He hates the idea of the Ascended self-proclaiming to be gods above mortals and sees their ongoing conflict with each other as a threat against his homeland.

Ntofo Mastery:
K'Sante wields two ntofos; massive and blunt tonfa-like weapons that he can wield with ease thanks to his immense physical strength. K'Sante has shown that he can deal immense blunt damage with his ntofos, striking with enough force that he can create fractures to the ground. Along with that, K'Sante can also use these weapons defensively, holding them up to create a nearly impenetrable
shield
. K'Sante's ntofos have been reengineered with slabs of the cobra-lion's regenerative hide, allowing K'Sante to
shatter
their heavy outer layer if he applies enough physical force. Once he does this, he can continue wielding the hidden blades within his ntofos, striking with more agility and sharpness. After a short period, the ntofos' outer layers regenerate.
Monster Hunting Mastery:
Thanks to years of training and studying the journal of his former lover
Tope
, K'Sante has proven to be one of the most talented and skilled monster hunters in
Nazumah
. He's capable of not only finding the weaknesses of beasts but also calculating when and where to strike to deal the most fatal damage to them. Along with that, his years of training has given him knowledge on how to harvest and craft materials collected from his hunts.

Tope

Tope and K'Sante trained and hunted together for years, becoming an extremely talented and inseparable duo of hunters. Eventually, the two confessed their love for one another and, after sharing their first kiss, grew into an official, romantic relationship. While hunting for the cobra-lion, K'Sante became more prideful of himself and often argued with Tope over their differing methods in hunting down the Baccai beast, eventually having a massive falling out and separating as lovers. K'Sante, having to hunt the beast alone, swallowed his pride and sought Tope's help once more, only to find out that he had moved back to Marrowmark. However, he had left behind his journal and his many studies on the beast, revealing to K'Sante his many plans and strategies to kill the cobra-lion, which ultimately proved effective in the end once he slew it.
The two reunited years later when battling some zealous followers of the
Ascended
Xerath
, fighting alongside each other as Tope nursed K'Sante back to health at his nearby camp over two days. Once awake, the two shared a meal together and reminisced on each other's lives, with K'Sante revealing a massive celebration being held for him and Tope having his wedding to a new lover that same time. Tope tried to apologize for leaving K'Sante during the hunt for the cobra-lion, but K'Sante interjected and stated that
he
should be apologizing instead for how he let his pride get the best of him and how he mistreated Tope in their relationship. Despite their past, the two hold a deep friendship and appreciation for one another, as K'Sante is genuinely happy that Tope found true love in his future husband and Tope is happy for K'Sante's new honorary title as the Pride of Nazumah.

Ascended

Historically, Nazumah is independent from the rule of the Shuriman emperor and denies any Ascended, seeing them as a threat. That said, K'Sante holds disdain for any of the Ascended, seeing them as one of the main threats he seeks to protect Nazumah from. With the growing conflict between
Azir
and
Xerath
, Nazumah is caught in the crossfire and K'Sante, as the Pride of Nazumah, fights against them and their followers.

Azir
[
edit

edit source
]

Nazumah rejects the rule of Azir as emperor and functions as a completely independent city-state. K'Sante has a disdain for Azir and his conquests over Shurima, seeing his rule as a threat to Nazuman culture. Though Xerath is responsible for atrocities against his people, such as the rampaging cobra-lion, he places blame on Azir as well for being the one that Xerath is fighting against.

Xerath
[
edit

edit source
]

The infamous cobra-lion that K'Sante and his lover Tope hunted years ago was actually the product of failed experiments by Xerath, as he attempted to fuse Shuriman fauna together with Ascension magic using a makeshift Sun Disc of his own. Because of that, K'Sante holds an even deeper hatred for Xerath, seeing him as a massive threat against his people due to the atrocities he's already committed.
K'Sante has battled many of Xerath's zealous followers already, most recently reuniting with his lover Tope to fight off a large band of them seeking to kill K'Sante and invade Nazumah.
