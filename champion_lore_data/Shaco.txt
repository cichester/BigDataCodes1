At some point, the prince that owned Shaco died, and through dark magic and corruption caused by the death of his owner, Shaco gained sentience. Soon, he started killing people and delighting in their pain. Shaco became a highly sought after fugitive by authorities due to his high number of crimes, and he is now a widely known criminal with no one knowing his origins or the motives behind his crimes.
