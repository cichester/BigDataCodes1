Sarah Fortune was born to the famous weapons manufacturer Abigail Fortune (her father's name is unknown), and lived with her mother in Bilgewater. Her mother taught her to make weapons of all kinds, the most prominent being firearms. Little Sarah's life was quite happy and pleasant, until the well-known looter Gangplank went to her mother's business to demand that she create two powerful pistols, to which Abigail accepted and said that in a year she would have them made.
After a year Gangplank returned but had no intention of paying Abigail. She finished the pistols and he took them from her, then proceeding to shoot Abigail, her husband, and finally Sarah. He went on to destroy the Fortunes' workshop, but miraculously, Sarah survived. With the little strength she had left, she managed to escape from the fire along with her mother's guns. Her body had recovered, but she began to suffer night terrors and post-traumatic stress from the incident, as well as an intense thirst for revenge.

Miss Fortune survived
Gangplank's
murder attempt which killed her mother and plotted to avenge her mother's death. She hired
Twisted Fate
to rob
Gangplank's
warehouse while also tipping off
Graves
about it. Both men acted as a massive distraction so that she could make final preparations to land the killing blow on
Gangplank
. When they later returned to
Bilgewater
in search of the Abyssal Crown, they angered a sea witch in the process. Miss Fortune, who had her quartermaster caught by the same witch, tricked and captured them both and then gave them to the witch in exchange for her quartermaster, but then helped T.F. and Graves escape.
Graves
holds a grudge against Sarah but still thinks she is impressive.
Between
Burning Tides
and
Shadow and Fortune
, Miss Fortune is purging
Bilgewater
of all those loyal to
Gangplank
after the power vacuum his 'death' caused (she is sure she can make Bilgewater prosper if the people are united under her banner). At one point before
Gangplank's
'death', him and Miss Fortune struck an uneasy truce in order to fight off the
Harrowing
, right on the shores of the
Serpent Isles
, in 'The Battle of Knife Straits'. They were successful (despite heavy casualties and their combined fleet scattering), while farther south
Nautilus
managed to fight off the rest of the undead.
