Early life
[

edit source
]

Yasuo was born in an Ionian village after his father came like an autumn wind into the life of his mother, who was already a widow. His father had left by the time winter settled over the land.
Yasuo grew up to be very close to his half-brother,
Yone
. However, in contrast to Yone’s respectful and patient personality, Yasuo was often arrogant and impulsive. But after being accepted into the village’s renowned sword school, his determination and talent caught the attention of Elder Souma, the last master of the legendary wind technique. He initially refused the tutelage of Elder Souma, but then Yone gave him a maple seed, symbolizing his plea for Yasuo to show humility. Subsequently, Yasuo accepted the master’s offer and became his apprentice and bodyguard.
Yasuo continued to train in the sword school, and his use of the wind technique made his sparring sessions with Yone a sight to behold.

Noxian Invasion
[

When news of the Noxian invasion and the Great Stand at Navori reached the school, many of the disciples, including Yone, chose to help defend against the approaching Noxians. Yasuo, however, was ordered to stay back and defend his elders.
Soon, Yasuo heard drums of a Noxian march and chose to go out and face the enemy, thinking he could turn the tide of the battle. But when he arrived at the battlefield, he found death everywhere. Something unnatural had caused hundreds of Noxians and Ionians to perish.
When Yasuo returned to the school, he found himself surrounded by the remaining students and learned that his master was dead. They accused him of murder, so he fought his way free in the hopes of punishing the true killer.
When Yasuo was tracked down by Yone, they clashed swords, and Yasuo cut down his half-brother, who died before he could grant any absolution.

Elder Souma

]

Yasuo is an
Ionian
swordsman once accused of
treason
for allegedly murdering Elder Souma, his own master whom he was supposed to protect. He was hunted down across the island continent under the evidence that the killer employed a wind technique, one that only Yasuo has mastered in the present day. He was forced to kill his former allies, likely the entirety of his school.

Taliyah

He later crossed paths with
Taliyah
while on the run, teaching the
Shuriman
stone mage how to control her powers. When they parted ways, she gifted him a long thread from her handspun wool tunic which he uses to tie his hair up.

Riven

After parting way with Taliyah, Yasuo became determined to find the true killer of his Elder. He suspected
Riven
of being the Elder's killer and confronted her. This was previously evidenced in interaction quotes with her.
"Wait, that
technique
... huh"
"Huh,
three
swift strikes... "
"Another
wind
blade?"
"Who taught you
that
?"
Eventually, Riven confessed to unintentionally killing Elder Souma, whose
wind
technique shattered her
blade
and killed him with a stray shard. However, Yasuo admitted to dereliction of duty, for he could have protected Elder Souma had he not left to engage the
Noxians
. Despite being cleared of his accusations, Yasuo is still infamously known across Ionia as the killer of his master.
Yasuo's presence or absence making a difference was highlighted during Riven's trial, when he focused the Wind Technique on Riven's sword as Souma would have, and the shard that killed his master nearly did the same to Asa Konte, Riven's adopted father. This time, Yasuo was able to stop the shard before it could cause any harm.

Yasuo is the younger half-brother to
Yone
, who he was very close to. Yone taught Yasuo many important lessons when he was young. When Yasuo was running away when accused of killing Elder Souma,
6
Yone
was heartbroken and filled with negative thoughts and feelings that fed an unknown azakana. When Yone finally caught up, Yasuo was forced to kill his own brother whose death would haunt him for a long time.
Later, when Yasuo went to the Spirit Blossom festival in
Weh'le
, he was confronted by a resurrected Yone who was trying to kill an azakana that pretended to be a monk from the
3
Greenglade Elder
order.

After Yasuo let go of his own past, his brother defeated it. Although Yasuo offered to let Yone have vengeance for his death, he replied that Yasuo might deserve death, but it wouldn't be from Yone. With that, Yasuo stated Ionia had nothing left for him and they parted ways in peace, with Yone saying that even the wind has a path and hoping that the Spirit of Ionia guides his brother.
