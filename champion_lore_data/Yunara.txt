Early Life

Yunara's parents entrusted her to the
Kinkou Order
to be raised under the tutelage of Master Lao, the
Fist of Shadow
who wielded a sacred relic known as the
Aion Er'na
. By the time she matured into an acolyte, a scourge had begun to plague the land.
Yunara fights the Darkin Kanmei

A number of the god-warriors from the
Darkin War
invaded
Ionia
and impersonated as benevolent Kanmei spirits. Lacking the virtues of peace, worship of these false idols eventually led to numerous conflicts across the nation. The
Kinkou
worked to repel the
Darkin
and their factions, with Master Lao sacrificing himself to save
Yunara
from one of their dreaded leaders. She then takes the office of the
Fist of Shadow
, as well as his weapon; taking an oath to uphold the balance, prune the tree of weakness, and to serve no false gods nor kanmei.

As the conflict grew dire, Yunara prayed to the
Great Spirit
of her temple to save her people. At first he spurned her plea over the affairs of mortals, but then grew animus over these Kanmei imposters. His aid came on one condition: Yunara would become his champion.

Together, the two warriors slowly purged the land of the Darkin. But upon their success, the Spirit confided that he was also Darkin, and that he must retreat in exile to protect the mortal realm from his true nature. The maiden staunchly remained beside him and they sequestered into the Temple of Twilight within the
Spirit Realm
, where she kept him contained within the Darkin Glaive. She gave her word to Great Master Bhinan that she would guard the temple and deliver judgments in her name.

In the following centuries, Yunara's sacrifice would be venerated as the
Tale of the Devoted Shrine Maiden
. She would remain at vigil until the Wyldbloom unexpectedly returned her shrine to the mortal realm.

Main article:
The Battle of Koeshin

Having returned to the mortal realm, Yunara found herself centuries in the future, and the Koeshin Spirit Blossom Festival was being attacked by
demonkin
who had arrived from the spirit realm. Fighting these demons was a traveler in foreign armor named
Xin Zhao
, and though Yunara was unsure who he was, she decided to trust him after learning he knew
Kennen
, and that the
yordle
and
Shen
, the
Kinkou's
new Eye of Twilight, remained frozen with inaction and talk. With Xin Zhao as her only ally, Yunara fought back against the demons and their leader, a demonic pretender who took the form of the
Grovemother
from
Ionian
folklore. Their battles with the pretender led them to defend the villagers, as other
wicked forces
stalked the forests around them.
By the end of the conflict, they had successfully slain the pretender, though Xin Zhao's
Demacian
spear had been broken in the process. Yunara and Xin then left to confer with Kennen, with Yunara demanding to speak with Shen in particular. Kennen reacted with shock upon seeing Yunara, as her post had been abandoned. Shortly after, a bell rang from the Temple of Twilight, signalling the wards had been breached. They went to investigate the matter immediately, with Yunara warning Xin Zhao that their "true test" lay ahead of them.

In
ancient legend
, Yunara was depicted as a kind and careful maiden who worried about her people and land, almost to the point of sacrificing herself for it.
Having been exiled to the
Spirit Realm
for more than 1000 years, Yunara has returned to an
Ionia
she does not recognize with modern customs she does not understand, and has also shown a lack of trust in the modern
Kinkou Order
's indecision and unwillingness to fight enemy invaders. As a fighter, her demeanor has become somewhat harsh towards both herself and others, but she remains faithful to her promisesâ€”the trait she became renowned for after the
Darkin War
. Yunara is also frequently hungry and believes a lack of food makes people "ornery".

During the
Darkin War
, Yunara requested aid from the Great Spirit against the "False Kanmei" who were ravaging the First Lands. In exchange for his help, Yunara took the spirit as her patron and swore loyalty to him, initially unaware that he was a
Darkin
like their enemies. When Ionia was once again at peace, the Great Spirit revealed his true nature to Yunara and was remorseful for deceiving her, but Yunara remained devoted and joined him in exile to the
Spirit Realm
, where she guarded the glaive he was sealed within.
