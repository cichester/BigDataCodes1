Early life
[

As the Starchild and one celestial being,
Soraka
and the inhabitants of the
celestial realm
watch the mortal realm and regarded the fledgling races of
Runeterra
with growing concern. The guidance and fates that had been woven into the night sky often went unseen—or worse, were misinterpreted by their simple mortal minds, leading to chaos, uncertainty, and suffering.
No longer able to merely watch, Soraka chose to descend to the mortal realm, determined to untangle the knots in the tapestry of the world.
And so Soraka came to be, and set upon her journey to soothe the mortals she encountered.

Contemporary history
[

Soraka quickly learned the capacity for cruelty that the peoples of Runeterra possessed. Whether on the battlefields of inescapable conflicts, in the seedy underbellies of sprawling cities, or on the frontiers of the untamed wilderness beyond them, there seemed to be no end to the fighting, betrayal, and suffering Soraka witnessed. She watched, helpless, as mortals ignorantly broke the threads of destiny they could have woven together. Their lives were too short, she reasoned. They were simply unable to see the greater patterns, now lost.
But as Soraka lived among them, as one of them, trying to repair what little of the damage she could... something incredible and wholly unforeseen happened.
Soraka noticed a new, unintended design emerging—intertwined, and of a staggering complexity.
Unintended and wild, the mortals were forging new and unknown futures for themselves. From the celestial realm above, it had seemed like pure chaos; but with her new perspective, and blessed by the stars to stand against the erosion of time, Soraka now beheld an almost perfect beauty. Just as mortals had the deepest capacity for cruelty, so too did they possess infinite potential for kindness, and inspiration to rival anything among the stars.
Soraka realized her place was not to repair or replicate the celestial pattern. While a part of her craved the fixed, comforting destinies of the stars, she knew in her heart that static fates could not contain the unbridled, dynamic potential of mortality.
And so her work took on renewed vigor, driven to unlock the untapped possibilities of all she met. Soraka sought now to inspire and guide rather than shepherd, to see what unblazed trails each mortal would discover for themselves in their brief, radiant moment.

Star Spring of the
Astral Grove
.

Over the millennia, legends of the Starchild have filtered through all the lands of Runeterra. Some tribes of the
Freljord
still speak of a far wanderer, a horned healer who soothed the icy bite of the most brutal winters. In the depths beneath
Zaun
, rumors float of a lilac skinned medic who would purify weary lungs from the ravages of the alchemical Gray. In troubled
Ionia
, the oldest myths of the
Vastayashai'rei
recall a seer who communed with the stars themselves, and called upon their light both to heal the wounded and scorch those who would do further harm to the First Lands.
Currently, Soraka calls the westernmost peaks of
Targon
,
Astral Grove
her home. There she created
2
Star Spring
a huge source of healing waters where she watches over
an isolated tribe
of
vastaya
, teaching them her healing ways, and tending quietly to her own needs as well as shepherding
Stellacorns
, alicorn creatures that fall from the celestial realm. They would aid them until maturity when they would send them back to the celestial realm—though what brings her so close to the great mountain, or how long she will stay, only Soraka knows.
Many times, she has watched entire civilizations dance close to the brink of destruction, and she has learned that she cannot save those who do not wish it, nor force them to see what they will not.
All the same, Soraka is determined never to stop trying.

Mount Targon
to prove to her family that she was not "weak". Soraka then tells her about
A young woman with pale hair
. Her counterpart,
a woman whose face burned as brightly as the sun
. And
a warrior with a spear
.
“All of these mortals ascended to the peak. But they had chosen that path with all their soul.” She turned to the girl and spoke slowly, taking no delight in her words. “You have not truly chosen the mountain. And Targon will not choose you. You would walk to your death. Don’t do this.”
then calling the girl to warm up and have tea, where she could leave at dawn, not to climb the mountain, but to start over and find a new path in her life.

Taric
nods, saying "Each life is uniquely faceted."
